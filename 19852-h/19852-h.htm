<h2><!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The Author of the following pages has been urged by numerous friends, 
and more particularly by his own conscience, to present to the Christian 
Public a brief account of the people called Gipsies, now wandering in 
Britain.&nbsp; This, to many readers, may appear inexpedient; as Grellman 
and Hoyland have written largely on this neglected part of the human 
family.&nbsp; But it should be recollected, that there are thousands of 
respectable and intelligent christians, who never have read, and never may 
read either of the above authors.&nbsp; The writer of the present work is 
partly indebted for the sympathies he feels, and which he wishes to awaken 
in others toward these miserable wanderers, to various authors who have 
written on them, but more particularly to <!-- page vi--><a 
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>Grellman and Hoyland, 
who, in addition to the facts which came under their own immediate notice, 
have published the observations of travellers and others interested in the 
history of this people.&nbsp; A list of these authors may be seen in the 
Appendix.</p>
<p>But his knowledge of this people does not entirely depend on the 
testimony of others, having had the opportunity of closely examining for 
himself their habits and character in familiar visits to their tents, and 
by allowing his door to be free of access to all those encamped near 
Southampton, when they have needed his help and advice.&nbsp; Thus has he 
gained a general knowledge of their vicious habits, their comparative 
virtues, and their unhappy modes of life, which he hopes the following 
pages will fully prove, and be the means of placing their character in the 
light of truth, and of correcting various mistakes respecting them, which 
have given rise to many unjust and injurious prejudices against them.</p>
<p><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
vii</span>The Author could have enlarged the present work very 
considerably, had he detailed all the facts with which he is well 
acquainted.</p>
<p>His object, however, was to furnish a work which should be concise and 
cheap, that he might be the means of exciting among his countrymen an 
energetic benevolence toward this despised people; for it cannot be denied 
that many thousands of them have never given the condition of the Gipsies a
single thought.</p>
<p>Such a work is now presented to the public.&nbsp; Whether the author has
succeeded, will be best known to those persons who have the most correct 
and extensive information relative to the unhappy race in question.&nbsp; 
Should he be the honoured instrument of exciting in any breasts the same 
feelings of pity, mercy, love and zeal for these poor English heathens, as 
is felt and carried into useful plans for the heathens abroad, by 
christians of all denominations; he will then be certain that, by the <!-- 
page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
viii</span>blessing of the Redeemer, the confidence of the Gipsies will be 
gained, and, that they will be led to that Saviour, who has said, 
<i>Whosoever cometh unto me</i>, <i>I will in no wise cast him out</i>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>CHAP. I.&nbsp; On the Origin of the Gipsies.</h2>
<p>Of the Origin of these wanderers of the human race, the learned are not 
agreed; for we have no authentic records of their first emigrations.&nbsp; 
Some suppose them to be the descendants of Israel, and many others, that 
they are of Egyptian origin.&nbsp; But the evidence adduced in confirmation
of these opinions appears very inconclusive.&nbsp; We cannot discover more 
than fifty Hebrew words in the language they speak, and they have not a 
ceremony peculiar to the Hebrew nation.&nbsp; They have not a word of 
Coptic, and but few of Persian derivation.&nbsp; And they are deemed as 
strangers in Egypt at the present time.&nbsp; They are now found in many 
countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa, in all of which they speak a 
language <i>peculiar to themselves</i>.&nbsp; On the continent of America 
alone are there none of them found.&nbsp; Grellman informs us that there 
were great numbers in Lorraine, and that they dwelt in its forests, before 
the French Revolution of 1790.&nbsp; He <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>supposes that there are
no less than 700,000 in the world, and that the greatest numbers are found 
in Europe.&nbsp; Throughout the countries they inhabit, they have kept 
themselves a distinct race of people in every possible way.</p>
<p>They never visit the Norman Isles; and it is said by the natives of 
Ireland, that their numbers are small in that country.&nbsp; Hoyland 
informs us, that many counties in Scotland are free of them, while they 
wander about in other districts of that country, as in England.&nbsp; He 
has also informed us, sec. 6, of a colony which resides during the winter 
months at Kirk Yetholm in the county of Roxburgh. <a 
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p>Sir Thomas Brown, in his work entitled &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Vulgar
Errors</span>,&rdquo; says, that they were seen first in Germany, in the 
year 1409.&nbsp; In 1418, they were found in Switzerland; and in 1422, in 
Italy.&nbsp; They appeared in France, on the 17th August, 1427.&nbsp; It is
remarkable that, when they first came into Europe, they were black, and 
that the women were still blacker than the men.&nbsp; From Grellman we 
learn, that &ldquo;in Hungary, there are 50,000; in Spain, 60,000; and that
they are innumerable in Constantinople.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears from the statute of the 22nd of Henry VIII, made against this
people, that they must at that time have been in England some years, and 
must have increased much in number, and in crime.&nbsp; In the 27th of that
reign, a law was made against the importation <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of such persons, 
subjecting the importer to 40<i>l</i> penalty.&nbsp; In that reign also 
they were considered so dangerous to the morals and comfort of the country,
that many of them were sent back to Calais.&nbsp; Yet in the reign of 
Elizabeth, they were estimated at 10,000. <a name="citation11a"></a><a 
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
<p>Dr Walsh says, that the Gipsies in Turkey, like the Jews, are 
distinguishable by indelible personal marks, dark eyes, brown complexion, 
and black hair; and by unalterable moral qualities, an aversion to labour, 
and a propensity to petty thefts. <a name="citation11b"></a><a 
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
<p>The celebrated traveller, Dr Daniel Clarke, speaks of great numbers of 
Gipsies in Persia, who are much encouraged by the Tartars.&nbsp; Formerly, 
and particularly on the Continent, they had their counts, lords, and dukes;
but these were titles without either power or riches.</p>
<p>The English Gipsies were formerly accustomed to denominate an aged man 
and woman among them, as their king and queen; but this is a political 
distinction which has not been recognized by them for many years.</p>
<p>If we suppose the Gipsies to have been heathens before they came into 
this country, their separation <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>from pagan degradation and cruelty, has been 
attended with many advantages to themselves.&nbsp; They have seen neither 
the superstitions of idolatry, nor the unnatural cruelties of 
heathenism.&nbsp; They are not destitute of those sympathies and 
attachments which would adorn the most polished circles.&nbsp; In 
demonstration of this, we have only to make ourselves acquainted with the 
fervour and tenderness of their conjugal, parental, and filial 
sensibilities,&mdash;and the great care they take of all who are aged, 
infirm, and blind, among them.&nbsp; Were these highly interesting 
qualities sanctified by pure religion, they would exhibit much of the 
beauty and loveliness of the christian character.&nbsp; I am aware that an 
opinion is general, that they are cruel to their children; but it may be 
questioned if ebullitions of passion are more frequent among them, in 
reference to their children, than among other classes of society; and when 
these ebullitions, which are not lasting, are over&mdash;their conduct 
toward their children is most affectionate.&nbsp; The attachment of Gipsy 
children to their parents is equally vivid and admirable; it grows with 
their years, and strengthens even as their connections increase. <a 
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp;
And indeed the affection that sisters and brothers have one for the other 
is very great.&nbsp; A short time since, the little sister of a <!-- page 
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Gipsy youth 
seventeen years of age, was taken ill with a fever, when his mind became 
exceedingly distressed, and he gave way to excessive grief and weeping.</p>
<p>Those who suppose these wanderers of mankind to be of Hindostanee or 
Suder origin, have much the best proof on their side.&nbsp; A real Gipsy 
has a countenance, eye, mouth, hands, ancle, and quickness of manners, 
strongly indicative of Hindoo origin.&nbsp; This is more particularly the 
case with the females.&nbsp; Nor is the above mere assertion.&nbsp; The 
testimony of the most intelligent travellers, many of whom have long 
resided in India, fully supports this opinion.&nbsp; And, indeed, persons 
who have not travelled on the Asiatic Continent, but who have seen natives 
of Hindostan, have been surprised at the similarity of manners and features
existing between them and the Gipsies.&nbsp; The Author of this work once 
met with a Hindoo woman, and was astonished at the great resemblance she 
bore in countenance and manners to the female Gipsy of his own country.</p>
<p>The Hindoo Suder delights in horses, tinkering, music, and fortune 
telling; so does the Gipsy.&nbsp; The Suder tribes of the same part of the 
Asiatic Continent, are wanderers, dwelling chiefly in wretched 
mud-huts.&nbsp; When they remove from one place to another, they carry with
them their scanty property.&nbsp; The English Gipsies imitate these erratic
tribes in this particular.&nbsp; They wander from place to place, and carry
their <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>small tents with them, which consist of a few bent sticks, and a 
blanket. <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14" 
class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; The Suders in the East eat the flesh of 
nearly every unclean creature; nor are they careful that the flesh of such 
creatures should not be putrid.&nbsp; How exactly do the Gipsies imitate 
them in this abhorrent choice of food!&nbsp; They have been in the habit of
eating many kinds of brutes, not even excepting dogs and cats; and when 
pressed by hunger, have sought after the most putrid carrion.&nbsp; It has 
been a common saying among them&mdash;<i>that which God kills</i>, <i>is 
better than that killed by man</i>.&nbsp; But of late years, with a few 
exceptions, they have much improved in this respect; for they now eat 
neither dogs nor cats, and but seldom seek after carrion.&nbsp; But in 
winter they will dress and eat snails, hedge-hogs, and other creatures not 
generally dressed for food.</p>
<p>But the strongest evidence of their Hindoo origin is the great 
resemblance their own language bears to the Hindostanee.&nbsp; The 
following Vocabulary is taken from Grellman, Hoyland, and Captain 
Richardson.&nbsp; The first of these respectable authors declares, that 
twelve out of thirty words of the Gipsies&rsquo; language, are either 
purely Hindostanee, or nearly related to it.</p>
<p>The following list of words are among those which bear the greatest 
resemblance to that language.</p>

<p>This language, called by themselves Slang, or Gibberish, invented, as 
they think, by their forefathers for secret purposes, is not merely the 
language of <i>one</i>, or a <i>few </i>of these wandering tribes, which 
are found in the European Nations; but is adopted by the vast numbers who 
inhabit the earth.</p>
<p>One of our reformed Gipsies, while in the army, was with his regiment at
Portsmouth, and being on garrison duty with an invalid soldier, he was 
surprised to hear some words of the Gipsy language unintentionally uttered 
by him, who was a German.&nbsp; On enquiring how he understood this 
language, the German replied, that he was of Gipsy origin, and that it was 
spoken by this race in every part of his native land, for purposes of 
secrecy. <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16" 
class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>A 
well known nobleman, who had resided many years in India, taking shelter 
under a tree during a storm in this country, near a camp of Gipsies, was 
astonished to hear them use several words he well knew were Hindostanee; 
and going up to them, he found them able to converse with him in that 
language.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a Missionary from India, who was well acquainted with the 
language of Hindostan, was at the Author&rsquo;s house when a Gipsy was 
present; and, after a conversation which he had with her, he declared, 
that, her people must once have known the Hindostanee language 
<i>well</i>.&nbsp; Indeed Gipsies have often expressed surprise when words 
have been read to them out of the Hindostanee vocabulary.</p>
<p>Lord Teignmouth once said to a young Gipsy woman in Hindostanee, <i>Tue 
burra tschur</i>, that is, <i>Thou a great thief</i>.&nbsp; She immediately
replied; No&mdash;<i>I am not a thief</i>&mdash;<i>I live by fortune 
telling</i>.</p>
<p>It can be no matter of surprise that this language, as spoken among this
people, is generally corrupted, when we consider, that, for many centuries,
they have known nothing of elementary science, and have been strangers to 
books and letters.&nbsp; Perhaps the secrecy necessary to effect many of 
their designs, has been the greatest means of preserving its scanty remains
among them.&nbsp; But an attempt to prove that they are <i>not</i> of <!-- 
page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Hindoo 
origin, because they do not speak the Hindostanee with perfect correctness,
would be as absurd as to declare, that, our Gipsies are not natives of 
England, because they speak very incorrect English.&nbsp; The few words 
that follow, and which occurred in some conversations the Author had with 
the most intelligent of the Gipsies he has met, prove how incorrectly they 
speak <i>our</i> language; and yet it would be worse than folly to attempt 
to prove that they are not natives of England.</p>

<p>Brand, in his observations on <span class="smcap">Popular 
Antiquities</span>, is of opinion that the first Gipsies fled from Asia, 
when the cruel Timur Beg ravaged India, with a view to proselyte the 
heathen to the Mohammedan religion; at which time about 500,000 human 
beings were butchered by him.&nbsp; Some suppose, that, soon <!-- page 
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>after this 
time, many who escaped the sword of this human fury, came into Europe 
through Egypt; and on this account were called, in English, <span 
class="smcap">Gipsies</span>.</p>
<p>Although there is not the least reason whatever to suppose the Gipsies 
to have had an Egyptian origin, and although, as we have asserted in a 
former page, they are strangers in that land of wonders to the present day;
yet it appears possible to me, that Egypt may have had something to do with
their present appellation.&nbsp; And allowing that the supposition is well 
founded, which ascribes to them a passage through Egypt into European 
nations, it is very likely they found their way to that place under the 
following circumstances.</p>
<p>In the years 1408 and 1409, Timur Beg ravaged India, to make, as has 
already been observed, proselytes to the Mohammedan delusion, when he put 
hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants to the sword.&nbsp; It is very 
rational to suppose, that numbers of those who had the happiness not to be 
overtaken by an army so dreadful, on account of the cruelties it 
perpetrated, should save their lives by flying from their native land, to 
become wandering strangers in another.&nbsp; Now if we assert that the 
Gipsies were of the Suder cast of Asiatic Indians, and that they found 
their way from Hindostan into other and remote countries when Timur Beg 
spread around him terrors so dreadful, it is natural to ask, why did not 
some of the other casts of India accompany them?&nbsp; This objection has 
no weight at all when we consider the hatred and contempt <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>poured upon the Suder 
by all the other casts of India.&nbsp; The Bramins, Tschechteries, and 
Beis, were as safe, though menaced with destruction by Timur Beg, as they 
would have been along with the Suder tribes, seeking a retreat from their 
enemy in lands where he would not be likely to follow them.&nbsp; Besides, 
the other casts, from time immemorial, have looked on their country as 
especially given them of God; and they would as soon have suffered death, 
as leave it.&nbsp; The Suders had not these prepossessions for their native
soil.&nbsp; They were a degraded people&mdash;a people looked on as the 
lowest of the human race; and, with an army seeking their destruction, they
had every motive to leave, and none to stay in Hindostan.</p>
<p>It cannot be determined by what track the forefathers of the Gipsies 
found their way from Hindostan to the countries of Europe.&nbsp; But it may
be presumed that they passed over the southern Persian deserts of Sigiston,
Makran and Kirman, along the Persian Gulph to the mouth of the Euphrates, 
thence to Bassora into the deserts of Arabia, and thence into Egypt by the 
Isthmus of Suez.</p>
<p>It is a fact not unworthy a place in these remarks on the origin of this
people, that they do not like to be called Gipsies, unless by those persons
whom they have reason to consider their real friends.&nbsp; This probably 
arises from two causes of great distress to them&mdash;<i>Gipsies are 
suspected and hated as the perpetrators of all crime</i>&mdash;<i>and they 
are almost universally prosecuted as vagrants</i>.&nbsp; Is it to be 
wondered at, that to strangers, <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>they do not like to acknowledge themselves as 
Gipsies?&nbsp; I think not.</p>
<p>We will conclude our remarks on the origin of these erratic sons of 
Adam, by adding the testimony of Col. Herriot, read before the Royal 
Asiatic Society, Sir George Staunton in the chair.&nbsp; That gentleman, 
giving an account of the Zingaree of India, says, that this class of people
are frequently met with in that part of Hindostan which is watered by the 
Ganges, as well as the Malwa, Guzerat, and the Decan: they are called Nath,
or Benia; the first term signifying a <i>rogue</i>&mdash;and the second a 
<i>dancer</i>, or <i>tumbler</i>.&nbsp; And the same gentleman cites 
various authorities in demonstration of the resemblance between these 
Gipsies and their neglected brethren in Europe.&nbsp; Nor does he think 
that the English Gipsies are so degraded as is generally supposed; in 
support of which he mentions some instances of good feeling displayed by 
them under his own observation, while in Hampshire.</p>
<h2><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>CHAP. II.&nbsp; Observations on the Character, Manners, and Habits
of the English Gipsies.</h2>
<p>The origin of this people is by no means of so much importance as the 
knowledge of their present character, manners and habits, with the view to 
the devising of proper plans for the improvement of their condition, and 
their conversion to christianity: for to any one who desires to love his 
neigbour as himself, their origin will be but a secondary 
consideration.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago the Gipsies had their regular journeys, and often 
remained one or two months in a place, when they worked at their 
trades.&nbsp; And as access to different towns was more difficult than at 
the present day, partly from the badness of the roads and partly from the 
paucity of carriers, they were considered by the peasantry, and by small 
farmers, of whom there were great numbers in those days, as very useful 
branches of the human family; I mean the industrious and better part of 
them.&nbsp; At that period they usually encamped in the farmers&rsquo; 
fields, or slept in their barns; and not being subject to the <i>driving 
system</i>, as they now are, they seldom robbed hedges; for their fires 
were replenished with dead-wood procured, without any risk of fines or 
imprisonments, from decayed trees and wooded banks.&nbsp; And it is proper 
to suppose, <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>that, at such a time, their outrages and depredations were very 
few.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that the Gipsies are very numerous, amounting
to about 700,000.&nbsp; It is supposed that there are about 18,000 in this 
kingdom.&nbsp; But be they less or more, we ought never to 
forget&mdash;that they are branches of the same family with 
ourselves&mdash;that they are capable of being fitted for all the duties 
and enjoyments of life&mdash;and, what is better than all, that they are 
redeemed by the same Saviour, may partake of the same salvation, and be 
prepared for the same state of immortal bliss, from whence flows to the 
universal church of Christ, that peace which the world cannot take from 
her.&nbsp; Their condition, therefore, at once commands our sympathies, 
energies, prayers, and benevolence.</p>
<p>Gipsies in general are of a tawny or brown colour; but this is not 
wholly hereditary.&nbsp; The chief cause is probably the lowness of their 
habits; for they very seldom wash their persons, or the clothes they wear, 
their linen excepted.&nbsp; Their alternate exposures to cold and heat, and
the smoke surrounding their small camps, perpetually tend to increase those
characteristics of complexion and feature by which they are at present 
distinguishable.</p>
<p>It is not often that a Gipsy is seen well-dressed, even when they 
possess costly apparel; but their women are fond of finery.&nbsp; They are 
much delighted with broad lace, large ear-drops, a variety of rings, and 
glaring colours; and, when they possess the <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>means, shew how great a
share they have of that foolish vanity, which is said to be inherent in 
females, and which leads many, destitute of the faith, and hope, and love, 
and humility of the gospel, into utter ruin.</p>
<p>A remarkable instance of the love of costly attire in a female Gipsy, is
well known to the writer.&nbsp; The woman alluded to, obtained <i>a very 
large sum of money</i> from three maiden ladies, pledging that it should be
doubled by her art in conjuration.&nbsp; She then decamped to another 
district, where she bought a blood-horse, a black beaver hat, a new 
side-saddle and bridle, a silver-mounted whip, and figured away in her 
ill-obtained finery at the fairs.&nbsp; It is not easy to imagine the 
disappointment and resentment of the covetous and credulous ladies, whom 
she had so easily duped.</p>
<p>Nor indeed are the males of this people less addicted to the love of gay
clothing, if it suited their interests to exhibit it.&nbsp; An orphan, only
ten years of age, taken from actual starvation last winter, and who was fed
and clothed, and had every care taken of him, would not remain with those 
who wished him well, and who had been his friends; but returned to the camp
from which he had been taken, saying, that he <i>would be a Gipsy</i>, 
<i>and would wear silver buttons on his coat</i>, <i>and have topped 
boots</i>; and when asked how he would get them, he replied&mdash;<i>by 
catching rats</i>.</p>
<p>Some Gipsies try to excel others in the possession of silver 
buttons.&nbsp; They will sometimes give as much as fifteen pounds for a 
set.&nbsp; The females too spend many <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>pounds on weighty gold 
rings for their fingers.&nbsp; The Author has by him, belonging to a Gipsy,
three massy rings soldered together, and with a half sovereign on the top, 
which serves instead of a brilliant stone.&nbsp; We pity a vain Gipsy whose
eyes are taken, and whose heart delights in such vulgar pomp.&nbsp; Are not
those equally pitiable, who estimate themselves only by the gaiety, 
singularity, or costliness of their apparel?&nbsp; The Saviour has given us
a rule by which we may judge persons in reference to their dress, as well 
as in other ostensibilities of character&mdash;<i>by their fruits ye shall 
know them</i>.</p>
<p>The Gipsies are not strangers to pawn-brokers shops; but they do not 
visit these places for the same purposes as the vitiated poor of our 
trading towns.&nbsp; A pawnshop is their bank.&nbsp; When they acquire 
property illegally, as by stealing, swindling, or fortune-telling, they 
purchase valuable plate, and sometimes in the same hour pledge it for 
safety.&nbsp; Such property they have in store against days of adversity 
and trouble, which on account of their dishonest habits, often overtake 
them.&nbsp; Should one of their families stand before a Judge of his 
country, charged with a crime which is likely to cost him his life, or to 
transport him, every article of value is sacrificed to save him from death,
or apprehended banishment.&nbsp; In such cases they generally retain a 
Counsellor to plead for the brother in adversity.</p>
<p>At other times they carry their plate about with them, and when visited 
by friends, they bring out from dirty bags, a silver tea-pot, and a 
cream-jug and spoons <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>of the same metal.&nbsp; Their plate is by no 
means paltry.&nbsp; Of course considerable property in plate is not very 
generally possessed by them.</p>
<p>The Gipsies of this country are very punctual in paying their 
debts.&nbsp; All the Shop-keepers, with whom they deal in these parts, have
declared, that they are some of their best and most honest customers.&nbsp;
For the payment of a debt which is owing to one of their own people, the 
time and place are appointed by them, and should the debtor disappoint the 
creditor, he is liable by their law of honour to pay double the amount he 
owes; and he must pay it by personal servitude, if he cannot with money, if
he wish to be considered by his friends honest and respectable.&nbsp; They 
call this law <i>pizharris</i>.</p>
<p>There are few of these unhappy people that can either read or 
write.&nbsp; Yet a regular and frequent correspondence is kept up between 
the members of families who have had the least advantage of the sort; and 
those who have had no advantages whatever, correspond through the kindness 
of friends who write for them.&nbsp; Numerous are the letters which they 
receive from their relatives in New South Wales, to which Colony so many 
hundreds of this unsettled race have been transported.&nbsp; Their letters 
are usually left at one particular post-office, in the districts where they
travel; and should such letters not be called for during a long period, 
they are usually kept by the post-master, who is sure they will be claimed,
sooner or later.&nbsp; A long journey will be no impediment, when a letter 
is expected; <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>for a Gipsy will travel any distance to obtain an expected favour 
of the kind.&nbsp; They are never heard to complain of the heavy expense of
postage.</p>
<p>We have already observed that there are many genuine features of 
humanity in the character of this degraded and despised people.&nbsp; Their
constantly retaining an affectionate remembrance of their deceased 
relatives, affords a striking proof of this statement.&nbsp; And their 
attachment to the horse, donkey, rings, snuffbox, silver-spoons, and all 
things, except the clothes, of the deceased relatives, is very 
strong.&nbsp; With such articles they will never part, except in the 
greatest distress; and then they only pledge some of them, which are 
redeemed as soon as they possess the means.</p>
<p>Most families visit the graves of their near relatives, once in the 
year; generally about the time of Christmas.&nbsp; Then the depository of 
the dead becomes a rallying spot for the living; for there they renew their
attachments and sympathies, and give and receive assurances of continued 
good will.&nbsp; At such periods however they are too often addicted to 
feasting and intemperance.</p>
<p>The graves of the deceased of this people, are usually kept in very good
order in the various Church yards where they lie interred.&nbsp; This is 
done by the Sextons, for which they are annually remunerated.&nbsp; 
Sometimes large sums of money are expended on the erection of head-stones; 
and in one instance a monument was erected in the County of Wilts at 
considerable cost.&nbsp; It is not very long since, that the parents of a 
deceased <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>Gipsy child, whom they loved very much, paid a great sum to have 
it buried in the Church.</p>
<p>The Gipsies have a singular custom of burning all the clothes belonging 
to any one among them deceased, with the straw, litter, &amp;c, of his 
tent.&nbsp; Whether this be from fear of infection, or from superstition, 
the Author has not been able to learn.&nbsp; Perhaps both unite in the 
continuation of a custom which must be attended with some loss to them. <a 
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<p>Seldom do these mysterious sons and daughters of Adam unite themselves 
in the holy obligations of marriage, after the form of the Established 
Church of our land.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, for so sacred a union, have they 
<i>any ceremony at all</i>.&nbsp; The parents on each side are consulted on
such occasions, and if their consent be obtained, the parties become, after
their custom, <i>husband and wife</i>.&nbsp; Should the parents object, 
like the thoughtless and imprudent persons in higher life, who flee to 
Gretna Green, the Gipsy lovers also escape from their parents to another 
district.&nbsp; When the couple are again met by the friends of the female,
they take her from her protector; but if it appear that he has treated her 
kindly, and is likely to continue to do so, they restore her to him, and 
all objections and animosities are forgotten.</p>
<p>As it seldom happens that they now stay more than a few days in one 
place, the Gipsy, his wife, and each <!-- page 29--><a 
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>of their children, may 
severally belong to different parishes.&nbsp; This is an objection to their
ultimate settlement in any one place.&nbsp; It will be some time before 
this objection can be removed: not till the present generation of Gipsies 
has passed away, and their posterity cease to make the wilderness their 
homes, choosing a parish for a permanent place of settlement.</p>
<p>It may naturally be expected that these inhabitants of the field and 
forest, the lane and the moor, are not without a knowledge of the medicinal
qualities of certain herbs.&nbsp; In all slight disorders they have 
recourse to these remedies, and frequently use the inner bark of the elm, 
star-in-the-earth, parsley, pellitory-in-the-wall, and wormwood.&nbsp; They
are not subject to the numerous disorders and fevers common in large towns;
but in some instances they are visited with that dreadful scourge of the 
British nation, the Typhus fever, which spreads through their little camp, 
and becomes fatal to some of its families.&nbsp; The small-pox and measles 
are disorders they very much dread; but they are not more disposed to 
rheumatic affections than those who live in houses.&nbsp; It is a fact, 
however, that ought not to be passed over here, that when they leave their 
tents to settle in towns, they are generally ill for a time.&nbsp; The 
children of one family that wintered with us in 1831, were nearly all 
attacked with fever that threatened their lives.&nbsp; This may be 
occasioned by their taking all at once to regular habits, and the 
renunciation of that exercise to which they have been so long accustomed, 
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>with 
some disposing qualities in their change of diet and the atmosphere of a 
thickly populated town.</p>
<p>This people often live to a considerable age, many instances of which 
are well known.&nbsp; In his tent at Launton, Oxfordshire, died in the year
1830, more than a hundred years of age, James Smith, called by some, the 
King of the Gipsies.&nbsp; By his tribe he was looked up to with the 
greatest respect and veneration.&nbsp; His remains were followed to the 
grave by his widow, who is herself more than a hundred years old, and by 
many of his children, grand-children, great grand-children, and other 
relatives; and by several individuals of other tribes.&nbsp; At the funeral
his widow tore her hair, uttered the most frantic exclamations, and begged 
to be allowed to throw herself on the coffin, that she might be buried with
her husband.&nbsp; The religion of the Redeemer would have taught her to 
say, <i>The Lord gave</i>, <i>and the Lord hath taken away</i>; <i>blessed 
be the name of the Lord</i>.</p>
<p>A woman of the name of B--- lived to the reputed age of a hundred and 
twenty years, and up to that age was accustomed to sing her song very 
gaily.&nbsp; Many events in the life of this woman were very 
remarkable.&nbsp; In her youth she was a noted swindler.&nbsp; At one time 
she got a large sum of money, and other valuable effects, from a lady; for 
which and other offences, she was condemned to die.&nbsp; A petition was 
presented to George the Third, to use the Gipsy&rsquo;s own expression, who
told the author, <i>just after he had set </i><!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span><i>up business</i>, 
that is, begun to reign, and he attended to its prayer.&nbsp; The sentence 
was reversed, and her life was consequently spared.&nbsp; But, poor woman, 
she repented not of her sins; for she taught her daughter to commit the 
same crimes for which she had been condemned; so that her delivery from 
condemnation led to no salutary reformation.</p>
<p>The mutual attachment which subsists between the nominal husband and 
wife, is so truly sincere, that instances of infidelity, on either side, 
occur but seldom.&nbsp; They are known strictly to avoid all conversation 
of an unchaste kind in their camps, except among the most degraded of them;
and instances of young females having children, before they pledge 
themselves to those they love, are rare.&nbsp; This purity of morals, among
a people living as they do, speaks much in their favour.</p>
<p>The anxiety of a Gipsy parent to preserve the purity of the morals of a 
daughter, is strongly portrayed in the following fact.&nbsp; The author 
wished to engage as a servant the daughter of a Gipsy who was desirous of 
quitting her vagrant life; but her mother strongly objected for some time; 
and when pressed for the reason of such objection, she named the danger she
would be in a town, far from a mother&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; It would be well 
if all others felt for their children as did this unlettered Gipsy.&nbsp; 
After having promised that the morals of the child should be watched over, 
she was confided to his care.&nbsp; And the author has known a Gipsy parent
correct with stripes a grown daughter, <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>for mentioning what a 
profligate person had talked about.</p>
<p>The following is an instance of conjugal attachment.&nbsp; A poor woman,
whose eldest child is now under the care of the Society for the improvement
of the Gipsies, being near her confinement, came into the neighbourhood of 
Southampton, to be with her friends, who are reformed, during the 
time.&nbsp; This not taking place so soon as she expected, and having 
promised to meet her husband at a distance on a certain day, he not daring 
to shew himself in Hampshire, she determined on going to him; and having 
mounted her donkey, set off with her little family.&nbsp; She had a 
distance of nearly fifty miles to travel, and happily reached the desired 
spot, where she met her husband before her confinement took place.&nbsp; 
The good people at Warminster, near which place she was, afforded her kind 
and needful assistance; and one well-disposed lady became God-mother to the
babe, who was a fine little girl; the grateful mother pledging that, at a 
proper age, she should be given up to Christians to be educated.</p>
<p>Before this woman left Southampton, referring to many kind attentions 
shewn her by the charitable of that place, she was heard to say, 
<i>Well</i>&mdash;<i>I did not think any one would take such trouble for 
me</i>!</p>
<p>Professing to be church people whenever they speak of religion, the 
Gipsies generally have their children baptized at the church near which 
they are born, <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>partly because they think it right, and partly, perhaps chiefly, 
to secure the knowledge of the parish to which the child belongs; for every
illegitimate child is parishioner in the parish in which it happens to be 
born.&nbsp; They will sometimes apply to the parish officers for something 
toward the support of a child, which they call <i>settling the 
baby</i>.</p>
<p>The sponsors at baptism are generally branches of the same family, and 
they speak of their God-children with pleasure, who in return manifest a 
high feeling of respect for them, and superstitiously ask their blessing on
old Christmas-days, when in company with them.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark
that all the better sort of Gipsies teach their children the <span 
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s Prayer</span>.</p>
<p>The anxiety evidenced by some parish officers to prevent these families 
from settling in their districts, has occasionally led the Gipsies to act 
unjustifiably by menacing them with the settlement of a number of their 
families; but this, from their perpetual wandering, need never be 
feared.&nbsp; Happy would it be for the Gipsies as a people, if these civil
officers did encourage them to stay longer in their neighbourhood; for they
then might be induced to commence and persevere in honest, industrious and 
regular habits.&nbsp; Not long ago thirty-five Gipsies came to a parish in 
Hampshire, to which they belonged, and demanded of the overseers ten 
pounds, declaring that, if that sum were not given them, they would remain 
there.&nbsp; Seven pounds were advanced, and they soon left the place.</p>
<h2><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>CHAP. III.&nbsp; The Character, Manners and Habits of the English 
Gipsies, continued.</h2>
<p>From the mode of living among the Gipsies, the parents are often 
necessitated to leave their tents in the morning, and seldom return to them
before night.&nbsp; Their children are then left in or about their solitary
camps, having many times no adult with them; the elder children then have 
the care of the younger.&nbsp; Those who are old enough gather wood for 
fuel; nor is stealing it thought a crime.&nbsp; By the culpable neglect of 
the parents in this respect, the children are often exposed to accidents by
fire; and melancholy instances of children being burnt and scalded to 
death, are not unfrequent.&nbsp; The author knows one poor woman, two of 
whose children have thus lost their lives, during her absence from her 
tent, at different periods: and very lately a child was scalded to death in
the parish where the author writes.</p>
<p>The Gipsies are not very regular in attending to the calls of appetite 
and hunger.&nbsp; Their principal meal is supper, and their food is 
supplied in proportion to the success they have had through the day; or, to
use their own words, <i>the luck they have met with</i>.</p>
<p>Like the poor of the land through which they wander, they are fond of 
tea, drinking it at every meal.&nbsp; <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>When times are hard 
with them, they use English herbs, of which they generally carry a stock, 
such as agrimony, ground-ivy, wild mint, and the root of a herb called 
spice-herb.</p>
<p>The trades they follow are generally chair-mending, knife-grinding, 
tinkering, and basket-making, the wood for which they mostly steal.&nbsp; 
Some of them sell hardware, brushes, corks, &amp;c.; but in general, 
neither old nor young among them, do much that can be called labour.&nbsp; 
And it is lamentable that the greatest part of the little they do earn, is 
laid by to spend at their festivals; for like many tribes of uncivilized 
Indians, they mostly make their women support their families, who generally
do it by swindling and fortune-telling.&nbsp; Their baskets introduce them 
to the servants of families, of whom they beg victuals, to whom they sell 
trifling wares, and tell their fortunes, which indeed is their principal 
aim, as it is their greatest source of gain.&nbsp; They have been awkwardly
fixed, both servants and the Gipsy fortune-teller, when the lady of the 
house has unexpectedly gone into the kitchen and surprised them while thus 
employed; and sometimes, to avoid detection, the obnoxious party has been 
hurried into a closet, or butler&rsquo;s pantry, where there has been much 
plate.&nbsp; Few are aware of the losses that have attended the conduct of 
unprincipled servants in this, as in other respects.&nbsp; It may be hoped 
that few families would knowingly look over conduct so improper, so 
dangerous.</p>
<p>Many of these idle soothsayers endeavour to persuade <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the people whom they 
delude, that the power to foretell future events, is granted to them from 
heaven, to enable them to get bread for their families.&nbsp; It would be 
well were the prognostications of these women encouraged only among 
servants; but this is not the case.&nbsp; They are often invited into gay 
and fashionable circles, whom they amuse, if, by the information possessed 
by the parties, they are not cunning enough to deceive.&nbsp; They are well
paid, and are thus encouraged in their iniquity by those who ought to know,
and <i>teach them</i> better.&nbsp; But it is astonishing how many 
<i>respectable</i> people are led away with the artful flattery of such 
visitors.&nbsp; They forget that the Gipsy fortune-teller has often made 
herself acquainted with their connexions, business, and future prospects, 
and consider not that God commits not his secrets to the wicked and 
profane.&nbsp; They use not the reason heaven has given them, and are 
therefore more easily led astray by these crafty deceivers.</p>
<p>They generally prophesy good.&nbsp; Knowing the readiest way to deceive,
to a young lady they describe a handsome gentleman, as one she may be 
assured will be her &ldquo;husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; To a youth they promise a 
pretty lady, with a large fortune.&nbsp; And thus suiting their deluding 
speeches to the age, circumstances, anticipations and prospects of those 
who employ them, they seldom fail to please their vanity, and often gain a 
rich reward for their fraud.</p>
<p>They suit their incantations, or their pretended means of gaining 
knowledge, to their employers.&nbsp; Two <!-- page 37--><a 
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>female servants went 
into the camp of some Gipsies near Southampton, to have their fortunes told
by one well known to the author, and a great professor of the art.&nbsp; On
observing them to appear like persons in service, she said to a companion, 
<i>I shall not get my books or cards for them</i>; <i>they are but 
tenants</i>.&nbsp; And calling for a frying-pan, she ordered them to fill 
it with water, and hold their faces over it.&nbsp; This being done, she 
proceeded to flatter and to promise them great things, for which she was 
paid 1<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i> each.&nbsp; This is called the frying-pan 
fortune.&nbsp; But it ought to be remembered that all fortune-telling is 
quite as contemptible.</p>
<p>These artful pretenders to a knowledge of future events, generally 
discover who are in possession of property; and if they be superstitious 
and covetous, they contrive to persuade them there is a lucky stone in 
their house, and that, if they will entrust to them, <i>all</i>, or a 
<i>part of their money</i>, they will double and treble it.&nbsp; Sorry is 
the author to say that they often gain their point.&nbsp; Tradesmen have 
been known to sell their goods at a considerable loss, hoping to have the 
money doubled to them by the supposed power of these wicked females, who 
daringly promise to multiply the blessings of Providence.</p>
<p>If the fortune-teller cannot succeed in obtaining a large sum at first, 
from such credulous dupes, she commences with a small one; and then 
pretending it to be too insignificant for the planets to work upon, she 
soon gets it doubled, and when she has succeeded <!-- page 38--><a 
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>in getting all she can,
she decamps with her booty, leaving her mortified victims to the just 
punishment of disappointment and shame, who are afraid of making their 
losses known, lest they should be exposed to the ridicule they 
deserve.&nbsp; Parties in Gloucestershire, Dorsetshire, and Hampshire, have
been robbed in this manner of considerable sums, even as much as three and 
four hundred pounds, the greatest part of which has been spent in 
Hampshire.</p>
<p>A young lady in Gloucestershire allowed herself to be deluded by a Gipsy
woman of artful and insinuating address, to a very great extent.&nbsp; This
lady admired a young gentleman, and the Gipsy promised that he would return
her love.&nbsp; The lady gave her all the plate in the house, and a gold 
chain and locket, with no other security than a vain promise that they 
should be restored at a given period.&nbsp; As might be expected, the 
wicked woman was soon off with her booty, and the lady was obliged to 
expose her folly.&nbsp; The property being too much to lose, the woman was 
pursued, and overtaken.&nbsp; She was found washing her clothes in a Gipsy 
camp, with the gold chain about her neck.&nbsp; She was taken up; but on 
restoring the articles, was allowed to escape.</p>
<p>The same woman afterwards persuaded a gentleman&rsquo;s groom, that she 
could put him in possession of a great sum of money, if he would first 
deposit with her, all he then had.&nbsp; He gave her five pounds and his 
watch, and borrowed for her ten more of two of his friends.&nbsp; She 
engaged to meet him at midnight in a <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>certain place a mile 
from the town where he lived, and that he there should dig up out of the 
ground a silver pot full of gold, covered with a clean napkin.&nbsp; He 
went with his pick-axe and shovel at the appointed time to the supposed 
lucky spot, having his confidence strengthened by a dream he happened to 
have about money, which he considered a favourable omen of the wealth he 
was soon to receive.&nbsp; Of course he met no Gipsy; she had fled another 
way with the property she had so wickedly obtained.&nbsp; While waiting her
arrival, a hare started suddenly from its resting place, and so alarmed 
him, that he as suddenly took to his heels and made no stop till he reached
his master&rsquo;s house, where he awoke his fellow servants and told to 
them his disaster.</p>
<p>This woman, who made so many dupes, rode a good horse, and dressed both 
gaily and expensively.&nbsp; One of her saddles cost &pound;30.&nbsp; It 
was literally studded with silver; for she carried on it the emblems of her
profession wrought in that metal; namely, a half-moon, seven stars, and the
rising sun.&nbsp; Poor woman! <i>her</i> sun is now nearly set.&nbsp; Her 
sins have found her out.&nbsp; She has been in great distress on account of
a son, who was transported for robbery; but has never thought of seeking, 
as a penitent, refuge in the God of mercy; for seeing one of her reformed 
companions reading the New Testament, she exclaimed, <i>That book will make
you crazy</i>, at the same time calling her a fool for burning her 
fortune-telling book.&nbsp; Her condition is now truly wretched; for her 
ill-gotten gains are all fled, and she is dragging out a miserable 
existence, refusing <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>still to seek the mercy of God, and despising 
those who have made him their refuge.</p>
<p>Another woman, whom the author would also call a <i>bad</i> Gipsy, who 
likewise practised similar deceptions, having persuaded a person to put his
notes and money in a wrapper and lock it up in a box, she obtained the 
liberty of seeing it in his presence, that she might pronounce certain 
words over it; and although narrowly watched, she contrived to steal it, 
and to convey into the box a parcel similar in appearance, but which on 
examination, contained only a bundle of rubbish.&nbsp; This money amounted 
to several hundred pounds.&nbsp; She was immediately pursued and taken with
the whole amount about her person.&nbsp; She was also allowed to escape 
justice, because the covetous old man neither wished to expose himself, nor
waste his money in a prosecution.</p>
<p>The daughter of this woman has followed the same evil and infamous 
practices; and the crime has descended to her through several 
generations.&nbsp; Many circumstances like the above are hid to prevent the
shame that would assuredly follow their exposure.&nbsp; But the day of 
Christ will exhibit both these deceivers and their dupes, who are equally 
heinous in the sight of God.&nbsp; It were well if such characters had paid
more attention to the words of the apostle Paul&mdash;<i>And having food 
and raiment</i>, <i>let us therewith be content</i>.&nbsp; <i>They that 
will be rich</i>, <i>fall into temptation</i>, <i>and a snare</i>, <i>and 
into many foolish and hurtful lusts</i>, <i>which drown men in 
destruction</i>.&nbsp; <i>The love of money is the root of all </i><!-- 
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
41</span><i>evil</i>; <i>which</i>, <i>while some have coveted after</i>, 
<i>they have erred from the faith</i>, <i>and pierced themselves through 
with many sorrows</i>.</p>
<p>Not to mention many other facts with which the author is acquainted, and
which he would relate, were he not likely thereby too much to enlarge his 
work, he will conclude this chapter with observing, that, thankfulness to 
Almighty God, for the blessings we enjoy, less anxiety about future events,
and more confidence in what God has revealed in his word and providence, 
would leave no room for the encouragement of Gipsy fortune-tellers, and 
their craft would soon be discontinued.</p>
<h2><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
42</span>CHAP. IV.&nbsp; The Character, Manners, and Habits of the English 
Gipsies, continued.</h2>
<p>Among this poor and destitute people, instances of great guilt, 
depravity and misery are too common; nor can it be otherwise expected, 
while they are destitute of the knowledge of salvation in a crucified and 
ascended Saviour.&nbsp; One poor Gipsy, who had wandered in a state of 
wretchedness, bordering on despair, for nearly forty years, had not in all 
that time, <i>heard of the Name which is above every name</i>; <i>for there
is salvation in no other</i>; till in his last days some Christian directed
him to the Bible, as a book that tells poor sinners the way to God.&nbsp; 
He gave a woman a guinea to read its pages to him; and he remunerated 
another woman, who read to him the book of Common Prayer.&nbsp; The last 
few years of his life were marked by strong conviction of sin.&nbsp; His 
children thought he must have been a murderer.&nbsp; They often saw him 
under the hedges at prayer.&nbsp; In his last moments he received comfort 
through a pious minister, who visited him in his tent, and made him 
acquainted with the promises of the gospel.</p>
<p>A similar instance has been related by a clergyman known to the author; 
nor should the interview of <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 43</span><span class="smcap">George the Third</span> 
with a poor Gipsy woman, be forgotten; for a brighter example of 
condescending kindness is not furnished in the history of kings.&nbsp; This
gracious monarch became the minister of instruction and comfort to a dying 
Gipsy, to whom he was drawn by the cries of her children, and saw her 
expire cheered by the view of that redemption he had set before her.</p>
<p>But how few are there of the tens of thousands of Gipsies, who have died
in Britain, that, whether living or dying, have been visited by the 
minister or his people!&nbsp; The father of three orphan children lately 
taken under the Care of the Southampton Committee for the improvement of 
the Gipsies, had lived an atheist, but such he could not die.&nbsp; He had 
often declared there was no God; but before his death, he called one of his
sons to him and said&mdash;<i>I have always said there was no God</i>, 
<i>but now I know there is</i>; <i>I see him now</i>.&nbsp; He attempted to
pray, but knew not how!&nbsp; And many other Gipsies have been so afraid of
God, that they dreaded to be alone.</p>
<p>It is a fact not generally known, that the Gipsies of this country have 
not much knowledge of one another&rsquo;s tribes, or clans, and are very 
particular to keep to their own.&nbsp; Nor will those who style themselves 
respectable, allow their children to marry into the more depraved 
clans.</p>
<p>The following are a few of the family names of the Gipsies of this 
country:&mdash;Williams, Jones, Plunkett, <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Cooper, Glover, Carew 
(descendants of the famous Bamfield Moore Carew), Loversedge, Mansfield, 
Martin, Light, Lee, Barnett, Boswell, Carter, Buckland, Lovell, Corrie, 
Bosvill, Eyres, Smalls, Draper, Fletcher, Taylor, Broadway, Baker, Smith, 
Buckly, Blewett, Scamp, and Stanley.&nbsp; Of the last-named family there 
are more than two hundred, most of whom are known to the author, and are 
the most ancient clans in this part of England.</p>
<p>It is a well-authenticated fact, that many persons pass for Gipsies who 
are not.&nbsp; Such persons having done something to exclude them from 
society, join themselves to this people, and marrying into their clans, 
become the means of leading them to crimes they would not have thought of, 
but for their connection with such wicked people.&nbsp; Coining money and 
forging notes are, however, crimes which cannot be justly attributed to 
them.&nbsp; Indeed it has been too much the custom to impute to them a 
great number of crimes of which they either never were guilty, or which 
could only be committed by an inconsiderable portion of their race; and 
they have often suffered the penalty of the law, when they have not in the 
least deserved it.&nbsp; They have been talked of by the public, and 
prosecuted by the authorities, as the perpetrators of every vice and 
wickedness alike shocking to civil and savage life.&nbsp; Nor is this to be
wondered at, living as they do, so remote from observation and the walks of
common life.</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>Whoever has read Grellman&rsquo;s Dissertation on the Continental 
Gipsies, and supposes that those of England are equally immoral and 
vicious, will be found greatly mistaken.&nbsp; The former are a banditti of
robbers, without natural affection, living with each other almost like 
brutes, and scarcely knowing, and assuredly never caring about the 
existence of God; some of them are even counted cannibals.&nbsp; The 
Gipsies of this country are altogether different; for monstrous crimes are 
seldom heard of among them.</p>
<p>The author is not aware of any of them being convicted of 
house-breaking, or high-way robbery.&nbsp; Seldom are they guilty of 
sheep-stealing, or robbing henroosts. <a name="citation45"></a><a 
href="#footnote45" class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; Nor can they be justly 
charged with stealing children; this is the work of worthless beggars who 
often commit far greater crimes than the Gipsies.</p>
<p>They avoid poaching, knowing that the sporting gentlemen would be severe
against them, and that they would not be permitted to remain in the lanes 
and commons near villages.&nbsp; They sometimes take osiers from the banks 
and coppices of the farmer, of which they make their baskets; and 
occasionally have been known to steal a sheep, but never when they have had
any thing to eat, or money to buy it with; for according to a proverb they 
have among themselves, <i>they despise those who risk their necks for their
bellies</i>.</p>
<p>The author however recollects a transgression of the <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>sort in the county of 
Hants.&nbsp; Eight Gipsy men united in stealing four sheep: four were 
chosen by lot for the purpose.&nbsp; They sharpened their knives, rode to 
the field, perpetrated the act, and before day-break brought to their camp 
the sheep they had engaged to steal; and, before the evening of the same 
day, they were thirty miles distant.&nbsp; But when pressed by hunger, they
have been known to take a worse method than this.&nbsp; For as the farmers 
seldom deny them a sheep that has died in the field, if they apply for it, 
<i>so many</i> were found dead in this way, that a certain farmer suspected
the Gipsies of occasioning their deaths.&nbsp; He therefore caused one of 
these animals to be opened, and discovered a piece of wool in its throat, 
with which it had been suffocated.&nbsp; The Gipsies, who had no objection 
to creatures that die in their blood, had killed all these sheep in the 
above manner.</p>
<p>Horse-stealing is one of their principal crimes, and at this they are 
very dextrous.&nbsp; When disposed to steal a horse, they select one a few 
miles from their tent, and make arrangements for disposing of it at a 
considerable distance, to which place they will convey it in a night.&nbsp;
An old and infirm man has been known to ride a stolen horse nearly fifty 
miles in that time.&nbsp; They pass through bye-lanes, well known to them, 
and thus avoid turnpikes and escape detection.</p>
<p>Unless they are taught better principles than at present they possess, 
and unless those on whom they impose, use their understandings, it is to be
feared that swindling also will long continue among them; for <!-- page 
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>they are so 
ingenious in avoiding detection.&nbsp; When likely to be discovered, a 
change of dress enables them to remove with safety to any distance.&nbsp; 
Instances of this kind have been innumerable.&nbsp; But as it is the aim of
this book to solicit a better feeling towards them, rather than expose them
to the continuation of censure, the writer will not enter into further 
detail in reference to their crimes, than barely to shew the great evils 
into which they have been led by many of those in high life, who have long 
encouraged them in the savage practice of prize-fighting.&nbsp; Pugilism 
has been the disgrace of our land, and our nobility and gentry have not 
been ashamed to patronize it.</p>
<p>Not long ago a fight took place in this county which will be a lasting 
disgrace to the neighbourhood.&nbsp; One of the pugilists, a Gipsy, in the 
pride of his heart, said during the fight, that he <i>never would be beaten
so long as he had life</i>.&nbsp; The poor wretch fought till not a feature
of his countenance could be seen, his head and face being swollen to a 
frightful size, and his eyes quite closed.&nbsp; He attempted to tear them 
open that he might see his antagonist; and was at last taken off the 
stage.&nbsp; Not satisfied with this brutal scene, the spectators offered a
purse of ten guineas for another battle.&nbsp; This golden bait caught the 
eye of another Gipsy, who, but a few months before, had ruptured a 
blood-vessel in fighting.&nbsp; Throwing up his hat on the stage, the sign 
of challenge, he was soon met with a fellow as degraded as himself, but 
with much more strength and activity.&nbsp; He was three times laid 
prostrate <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>at the feet of his antagonist, and was taken away almost 
lifeless.&nbsp; His conqueror put a half-crown into his hand as he was 
carried off, saying, it was a little something for him to drink.&nbsp; 
About three months after this, the author saw this poor Gipsy in his tent, 
in the last stage of a consumption; but he was without any marks of true 
penitence.&nbsp; Surely the way of wickedness is full of misery!</p>
<p>What a disgrace is this demoralizing mode of amusement to our 
country!&nbsp; Degrading to the greatest degree, it is nevertheless pursued
with avidity by all classes of people; and large bets are often depending 
on these brutal exercises.&nbsp; Gentlemen, noblemen, and even ladies, are,
on such occasions, mixed with the most degraded part of the 
community.&nbsp; In the instance referred to it is said, that fifty pounds 
were taken by admitting carriages into the field in which the fight took 
place.&nbsp; Where were the peace-officers at this time?&nbsp; Perhaps some
of them spectators of the horrid scene!</p>
<p>Verily our men of rank and fortune are guilty in encouraging these 
shocking practices; and they are little better than murderers, who goad 
their fellow-men on to fight by the offer of money.&nbsp; Such persons are 
frequently instruments of sending sinners, the most unprepared, into the 
presence of a righteous God.&nbsp; What an account will they have to give 
when they meet the victims of their amusement at the bar of Christ!</p>
<p>The Gipsies often fight with each other at fairs, and <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>other places where they
meet in great numbers.&nbsp; This is their way of settling old grudges; but
so soon as one yields, the quarrel is made up, and they repair to a public 
house to renew their friendship.&nbsp; This forgiving spirit is a pleasing 
trait in their character.</p>
<h2><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>CHAP. V.&nbsp; Further Account of the English Gipsies.</h2>
<p>It has been the lot of Gipsies in all countries to be despised, 
persecuted, hated, and have the vilest things said about them.&nbsp; In 
many cases they have too much merited the odium which they have experienced
in continental Europe; but certainly they are not deserving of universal 
and unqualified contempt and hatred in this nation.&nbsp; The dislike they 
have to rule and order has led many of them to maim themselves by cutting 
off a finger, that they might not serve in either the army or the navy: and
I believe there is one instance known, of some Gipsies murdering a witness 
who was to appear against some of their people for horse-stealing: the 
persons who were guilty of the deed have been summoned to the bar of 
Christ, and in their last moments exclaimed with horror and despair, 
&ldquo;Murder, murder.&rdquo;&nbsp; But these circumstances do not stamp 
their race without exception as infamous monsters in wickedness.&nbsp; Not 
many years since several of their men were hung in different places for 
stealing fourteen horses near Bristol, who experienced the truth of that 
scripture, <i>be sure your sins will find you out</i>.&nbsp; Indeed there 
is not a family among them that has not to mourn over the loss of some 
relative for <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>the commission of this crime.&nbsp; But even in this respect their
guilt has been much over-rated; for in many cases it is to be feared they 
have suffered innocently.&nbsp; There was formerly a reward of 40<i>l</i> 
to those who gave information of offenders, on their being capitally 
convicted.&nbsp; Those of the lower orders, therefore, who were destitute 
of principle, had a great temptation before them to swear falsely in 
reference to Gipsies; and of which it is known they sometimes availed 
themselves, knowing that few would befriend them.&nbsp; For the sake of the
above sum, vulgarly, but too justly called <i>blood-money</i>, they 
perjured themselves, and were much more wicked than the people they 
accused.&nbsp; But the Gipsies were thought to be universally depraved, and
no one thought it worth his while to investigate their innocence.&nbsp; Let
us be thankful that many at the present day look upon them with better 
feelings.</p>
<p>Very lately one of these vile informers swore to having seen a Gipsy man
on a horse that had been stolen; and although it came out on the trial, 
that it was night when he observed him, and that he had never seen him 
before, which ought to have rendered his evidence invalid, the prisoner was
convicted and condemned to die.&nbsp; His life was afterwards spared by 
other facts having been discovered and made known to the judge, after he 
had left the city.</p>
<p>The Gipsies in this country have for centuries been accused of 
child-stealing; and therefore it is not to be wondered at, that, when 
children have been missing, the Gipsies should be taxed with having stolen 
them.&nbsp; <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>About thirty years since, some parents who had lost a child, 
applied to a man at Portsmouth, well known in those days, by the name of 
Payne, or Pine, as an astrologer, wishing to know from him what was become 
of it.&nbsp; He told them <i>to search the Gipsy tents for twenty miles 
round</i>.&nbsp; The distressed parents employed constables, who made 
diligent search in every direction to that distance, but to no purpose; the
child was not to be found in their camps.&nbsp; It was however soon 
afterwards discovered, drowned in one of its father&rsquo;s pits, who was a
tanner.&nbsp; Thus was this pretended astrologer exposed to the ridicule of
those who but a short time before foolishly looked on him as an oracle.</p>
<p>On another occasion the same accusation was brought against the Gipsies,
and proved to be false.&nbsp; The child of a widow at Portsmouth was lost, 
and after every search was made on board the ships in the harbour, and at 
Spithead, and the ponds dragged in the neighbourhood, to no effect, it was 
concluded that the Gipsies had stolen him.&nbsp; The boy was found a few 
years afterwards, at Kingston-upon-Thames, apprenticed to a chimney 
sweeper.&nbsp; He had been enticed away by a person who had given him 
sweet-meats; but not by a Gipsy.</p>
<p>I may be allowed here to say a word about this boy&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp;
She was a good and pious woman, and had known great trials.&nbsp; Her 
husband was drowned in her presence but a short time before she lost her 
son in the mysterious way mentioned; and before he was heard of, she was 
removed to the enjoyment of a better <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>world.&nbsp; Her death 
was a very happy one, for it took place while she was engaged in public 
worship.&nbsp; <i>Many are the afflictions of the righteous</i>, <i>but the
Lord delivereth them out of them all</i>.</p>
<p>Instances have been known of house-breakers leaving some of their stolen
goods near the tents of the Gipsies; and these being picked up by the 
children, and found upon them, have been the cause of much unjust suffering
among them.&nbsp; The grandfather of three little orphans now under the 
care of the Southampton Committee, was charged with stealing a horse, and 
was condemned and executed; although the farmer of whom he bought it, came 
forward and swore to the horse being the same which he had sold him.&nbsp; 
His evidence was rejected on account of some slight mistake in the 
description he gave of it.&nbsp; When under the gallows, the frantic Gipsy 
exclaimed&mdash;<i>Oh God</i>, <i>if thou dost not deliver me</i>, <i>I 
will not believe there is a God</i>!</p>
<p>The following anecdote will prove the frequent oppression of this 
people.&nbsp; Not many years since, a collector of taxes in a country town,
said he had been robbed of fifty pounds by a Gipsy; and being soon after at
Blandford in Dorsetshire, he fixed on a female Gipsy, as the person who 
robbed him in company with two others, and said she was in man&rsquo;s 
clothes at the time.&nbsp; They were taken up and kept in custody for some 
days; and had not a farmer voluntarily come forward, and proved that they 
were many miles distant when the robbery was said to be perpetrated, they 
would have been tried for their lives, and probably <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>hanged.&nbsp; The woman
was the wife of Wm. Stanley, (who was in custody with her,) who now reads 
the Scriptures in the Gipsy tents near Southampton.&nbsp; Their wicked 
accuser was afterwards convicted of a crime for which he was condemned to 
die, when he confessed that he had not been robbed at the time referred to,
but had himself spent the whole of the sum in question.</p>
<p>Another Gipsy of the name of Stanley was lately indicted at Winchester, 
for house-breaking, and had not his friends at great expense proved an 
<i>alibi</i>, it is likely he might have been executed.&nbsp; And in this 
way have they been suspected and persecuted ever since the days of Henry 
the Eighth.&nbsp; They have been hunted like wild beasts; their property 
has been taken from them; themselves have been frequently imprisoned, and 
in many cases their lives taken, or what to many of them would be much 
worse, they have been transported to another part of the world, for ever 
divided from their families and friends.</p>
<p>In the days of Judge Hale, thirteen of these unhappy beings were hanged 
at Bury St Edmonds, for no other cause than that they were Gipsies; and at 
that time it was death without benefit of clergy, for any one to live among
them for a month.&nbsp; Even in later days two of the most industrious of 
this people have had a small pony and two donkeys taken away merely on 
suspicion that they were stolen.&nbsp; They were apprehended and carried 
before a magistrate, to whom they proved that the animals were their own, 
<!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>and 
that they had legally obtained them.&nbsp; The cattle were then pounded for
trespassing on the common, and if their oppressed owners had not had money 
to defray the expenses, one of the animals must have been sold for that 
purpose.</p>
<p>Not long ago, one of the Gipsies was suspected of having stolen lead 
from a gentleman&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; His cart was searched, but no lead 
being found in his possession, he was imprisoned for three months, for 
living under the hedges as a vagrant; and his horse, which was worth 
thirteen pounds, was sold to meet the demands of the constables.&nbsp; And 
another Gipsy, who had two horses in his possession, was suspected of 
having stolen them, but he proved that they were legally his 
property.&nbsp; He was committed for three months as a vagrant, and one of 
his horses was sold to defray the expenses of his apprehension, 
examination, &amp;c.</p>
<p>While writing this part of the <span class="smcap">Gipsies&rsquo; 
Advocate</span>, the author knows that a poor, aged, industrious woman, 
with whom he has been long acquainted, had her donkey taken from her, and 
that a man with four witnesses swore that it was his property.&nbsp; The 
poor woman told a simple, artless tale to the magistrates, and was not 
fully committed.&nbsp; She was allowed two days to bring forward the person
of whom she bought it.&nbsp; Conscious of her innocence, she was willing to
risk a prison if she could recover her donkey, and establish her 
character.&nbsp; After a great deal of trouble and expense in dispatching 
messengers to bring forward <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>her witnesses, she succeeded in obtaining 
them.&nbsp; They had no sooner made their appearance than the accuser and 
his witnesses fled, and left the donkey to the right owner, the poor, 
accused and injured woman.</p>
<p>It cannot be expected that oppression will ever reform this people, or 
cure them of their wandering habits.&nbsp; Far more likely is it to confirm
them in their vagrant propensities.&nbsp; And as their numbers do not 
decrease, oppression will only render them the dread of one part of their 
fellow-creatures, while it will make them the objects of scorn and obloquy 
to others.</p>
<p>It is the earnest wish of the author that milder measures may be pursued
in reference to the Gipsies.&nbsp; To endeavour to improve their morals, 
and instruct them in the principles of religion, will, under the divine 
blessing, turn to better account than the hateful and oppressive policy so 
long adopted.</p>
<h2><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>CHAP. VI.&nbsp; Further Account of the English Gipsies.</h2>
<p>Many persons are of opinion in reference to the Gipsies, that, if all 
the parishes were alike severe in forcing them from their retreats, they 
would soon find their way into towns.&nbsp; But if this were the case, what
advantage would they derive from it?&nbsp; In large towns, in their present
ignorant and depraved state, would they not be still more wicked?&nbsp; 
They would change their condition only from bad to worse, unless they were 
treated better than they now are, and could be properly employed; but from 
the prejudice that exists among all classes of men against them, this is 
not likely to be the case: they would not be employed by any, while other 
persons could be got.&nbsp; At a hop plantation, so lately as 1830, Gipsies
were not allowed to pick hops in some grounds, while persons as unsettled 
and undeserving, were engaged for that purpose.&nbsp; Had this been a 
parochial arrangement to benefit the poor of their own neighbourhood, who 
were out of employ, it were not blameable.</p>
<p>If they were driven to settle in towns, and could not, generally 
speaking, obtain employment, it might soon become necessary to remove all 
their children to their own parishes; a measure not only very unhappy <!-- 
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>in itself,
but one to which the Gipsies would never submit.&nbsp; Sooner would they 
die than suffer their children to go to the parish workhouses.</p>
<p>The severe and unchristian-like treatment they meet with from many, only
obliges them to travel further, and often drives them to commit greater 
depredations.&nbsp; When driven by the constables from their station, they 
retire to a more solitary place in another parish, and there remain till 
they are again detected, and again mercilessly driven away.&nbsp; But this 
severity does not accomplish the end it has in view; their numbers remain 
the same, and they retain the same dislike to the crowded haunts of 
man.&nbsp; For they only visit towns in small parties, offering trifling 
wares for sale, or telling fortunes; and this is done to gain a present 
support.</p>
<p>In this neighbourhood there was lately a sweeping of the commons and 
lanes of the Gipsy families.&nbsp; Their horses and donkeys were driven 
off, and the sum of &pound;3 5<i>s</i> levied on them as a fine to pay the 
constables for thus afflicting them.&nbsp; In one tent during this 
distressing affair, there was found an unburied child, that had been 
scalded to death, its parents not having money to defray the expenses of 
its interment.&nbsp; The constables declared that it would make any heart 
ache to see the anguish the poor people were in, when thus inhumanly driven
from their resting places; but, said they, <i>We were obliged to do our 
duty</i>.&nbsp; To the credit of these men, thirteen in number, it should 
be mentioned, that, with only one exception, they returned the <!-- page 
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>fines to the 
people; and one of them, who is a carpenter, offered a coffin for the 
unburied child, should the parish be unwilling to bury it.</p>
<p>In this instance of their affliction and grief, the propensity to accuse
these poor creatures was strongly marked by a report charging them with 
having dug a grave on the common in which to bury it; a circumstance very 
far from their feelings and general habits.&nbsp; The fact was, some person
had been digging holes in search of gravel, and these poor creatures 
pitched their tent just by one of them.</p>
<p>It was supposed by many in this neighbourhood, that the poor wretches 
thus driven away, were gone out of the country; but this was not the 
case.&nbsp; They had only retired to more lonely places in smaller parties,
and were all seen again a few days after at a neighbouring fair.&nbsp; This
circumstance is sufficient to prove that they are not to be reclaimed by 
prosecutions and fines.&nbsp; It is therefore high time the people of 
England should adopt more merciful measures towards them in endeavouring to
bring them into a more civilized state.&nbsp; The money spent in sustaining
prosecutions against them, if properly applied, would accomplish this great
and benevolent work.&nbsp; And without flattering any of its members, the 
author thinks the Committee at Southampton have discovered plans, wholly 
different to those usually adopted, which may prove much more effectual in 
accomplishing their reformation; for by these plans being put in prudent 
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>operation, many have already ceased to make the lanes and commons 
their home; and their minds are becoming enlightened and their characters 
religious.</p>
<p>In concluding this chapter it may not be improper to remark, that, bad 
as may be the character of any of our fellow-creatures, it is very 
lamentable that they should suffer for crimes of which individually they 
are not guilty.&nbsp; Let us hope that, in reference to this people, unjust
executions have ceased; that people will be careful in giving evidence 
which involves the rights, liberties, and lives of their fellow-creatures, 
though belonging to the unhappy tribes of Gipsies; and above all, let us 
hope, that such measures will be pursued by the good and benevolent of this
highly favoured land, as will place them in situations where they will 
learn to fear God, and support themselves honestly in the sight of all 
men.</p>
<h2><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>CHAP. VII.&nbsp; Of the formation of the Southampton Committee, 
and the success that has attended its endeavours.</h2>
<p>Although the Gipsies, on account of their unsettled habits, their 
disposition to evil practices, and that ignorance of true religion, which 
is inseparably connected with a life remote from all the forms of external 
worship, and from the influence of religious society, may be said to be in 
a most lamentably wretched state; yet is their condition not 
desperate.&nbsp; They are rational beings, and have many feelings 
honourable to human nature.&nbsp; They are not as the heathens of other 
countries, addicted to any system of idolatry; and what is of infinite 
encouragement, they inhabit a land of Bibles and of Christian ministers; 
and, although at present, they derive so little benefit from these 
advantages, there are many of them willing to receive instruction.&nbsp; 
The following details, to which I gladly turn, will shew that, when 
<i>patient</i> and <i>persevering</i> means are used, Gipsies may be 
brought to know God; and no body of people were ever yet converted to 
Christianity without means.&nbsp; The following circumstances gave rise to 
the idea of forming a society for the improvement of this people.</p>
<p>In March, 1827, during the Lent Assizes, the author <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>was in Winchester, and 
wishing to speak with the sheriff&rsquo;s chaplain, he went to the court 
for that purpose.&nbsp; He happened to enter just as the judge was passing 
sentence of death on two unhappy men.&nbsp; To one he held out the hope of 
mercy; but to the other, <i>a poor Gipsy</i>, who was convicted of 
horse-stealing, he said, <i>no hope could be given</i>.&nbsp; The young 
man, for he was but a youth, immediately fell on his knees, and with 
uplifted hands and eyes, apparently unconscious of any persons being 
present but the judge and himself, addressed him as follows: 
&ldquo;<i>Oh</i>! <i>my Lord</i>, <i>save my life</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
judge replied, &ldquo;<i>No</i>; <i>you can have no mercy in this 
world</i>: <i>I and my brother judges have come to the determination to 
execute horse-stealers</i>, <i>especially Gipsies</i>, <i>because of the 
increase of the crime</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The suppliant, still on his knees, 
entreated&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Do</i>, <i>my Lord Judge</i>, <i>save my 
life</i>! <i>do</i>, <i>for God&rsquo;s sake</i>, <i>for my wife&rsquo;s 
sake</i>, <i>for my baby&rsquo;s sake</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;<i>No</i>,&rdquo; replied the judge, &ldquo;<i>I cannot</i>: <i>you 
should have thought of your wife and children before</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
then ordered him to be taken away, and the poor fellow was <i>rudely 
dragged</i> from his earthly judge.&nbsp; It is hoped, as a penitent 
sinner, he obtained the more needful mercy of God, through the abounding 
grace of Christ.&nbsp; After this scene, the author could not remain in 
court.&nbsp; As he returned, he found the mournful intelligence had been 
communicated to some Gipsies who had been waiting without, anxious to learn
the fate of their companion.&nbsp; They seemed distracted.</p>
<p>On the outside of the court, seated on the ground, <!-- page 63--><a 
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>appeared an old woman, 
and a very young one, and with them two children, the eldest three years, 
and the other an infant but fourteen days old.&nbsp; The former sat by its 
mother&rsquo;s side, alike unconscious of her bitter agonies, and of her 
father&rsquo;s despair.&nbsp; The old woman held the infant tenderly in her
arms, and endeavoured to comfort its weeping mother, soon to be a widow 
under circumstances the most melancholy.&nbsp; <i>My dear</i>, 
<i>don&rsquo;t cry</i>, said she, <i>remember you have this dear little 
baby</i>.&nbsp; Impelled by the sympathies of pity and a sense of duty, the
author spoke to them on the evil of sin, and expressed his hope that the 
melancholy event would prove a warning to them, and to all their 
people.&nbsp; The poor man was executed about a fortnight after his 
condemnation.</p>
<p>This sad scene, together with Hoyland&rsquo;s Survey of the Gipsies, 
which the author read about this time, combined to make a deep impression 
on his mind, and awaken an earnest desire which has never since decreased, 
to assist and improve this greatly neglected people.&nbsp; The more he 
contemplated their condition and necessities, the difficulties in the way 
of their reformation continued to lessen, and his hope of success, in case 
any thing could be done for them, became more and more confirmed.&nbsp; He 
could not forget the poor young widow whom he had seen in such deep 
distress at Winchester, and was led to resolve, if he should meet her 
again, to offer to provide for her children.</p>
<p>Some weeks elapsed before he could hear any thing of her, till one day 
he saw the old woman sitting on <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the ground at the entrance of Southampton, with
the widow&rsquo;s infant on her knee.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is your 
daughter?&rdquo; he inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she replied, 
&ldquo;She is my niece; she is gone into the town.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
you desire her to call at my house?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, sir,&rdquo;
said the poor old woman, to whom the author gave his address.</p>
<p>In about an hour after this conversation, the widow and her aunt 
appeared.&nbsp; After inviting them to sit down, he addressed the young 
woman thus:&mdash;&ldquo;My good woman, you are now a poor widow, and I 
wished to see you, to tell you that I would be your friend.&nbsp; I will 
take your children, if you will let me have them, and be a father to them, 
and educate them; and, when old enough to work, will have them taught some 
honest trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said she; 
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like to part with my children.&nbsp; The chaplain 
at the prison offered to take my oldest, and to send her to London to be 
taken care of; but I could not often see her there.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied,
&ldquo;I commend you for not parting with her, unless you could 
occasionally see her; for I suppose you love your children 
dearly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! yes, sir,&rdquo; said the widow.&nbsp; The 
old aunt also added, &ldquo;Our people set great store by their 
children.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I do not wish 
you to determine on this business hastily; it is a weighty one.&nbsp; You 
had better take a fortnight for consideration, and then give me a second 
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How improbable did it then appear that this interview would ultimately 
lead to so much good to many of her people!&nbsp; When the fortnight 
expired, the widow <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and her aunt again appeared, when the following
conversation took place.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad you are come again,&rdquo; 
said their friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the widow, &ldquo;and I
will now let you have my Betsy;&rdquo; and the aunt immediately added, 
pointing to one of her grand-children, &ldquo;I will let you have my little
<i>deary</i>, if you will take care of her.&nbsp; Her father,&rdquo; 
continued she, &ldquo;was condemned to die, but is transported for life, 
and her mother now lives with another man.&rdquo;&nbsp; The proposal was 
readily accepted; and three days after, these two children were brought 
washed very clean, and dressed in their best clothes.&nbsp; It was promised
the women, that they should see their children whenever they chose, and all
parties were pleased.&nbsp; The eldest of these children was six years of 
age; the widow&rsquo;s little daughter, only three.&nbsp; The first day 
they amused themselves with running up and down stairs, and through the 
rooms of the house.&nbsp; But when put to bed at night, they cried for two 
hours, saying that the house would fall upon them.&nbsp; They had never 
spent a day in a house before, and were at night like birds that had been 
decoyed, and then robbed of their liberty.&nbsp; A few kisses and some 
promises at length quieted them, and they went to sleep.</p>
<p>After remaining with the author three days, they were removed to one of 
the Infants&rsquo; Schools, where they were often visited by the widow and 
her aunt.&nbsp; Soon after this the eldest girl was taken ill.&nbsp; A 
medical gentleman attended her at the tent, a little way from the town, 
whither her grandmother had begged <!-- page 66--><a 
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>to remove her for 
change of air.&nbsp; But the sickness of this child <i>was unto 
death</i>.&nbsp; She was a lovely and affectionate girl, notwithstanding 
the disadvantages under which she had necessarily laboured.&nbsp; When on 
her bed, in the tent, suffering much pain, she was asked by a gentleman, 
&ldquo;Although you love Mr Crabb so much, would you rather live with him, 
or die, and go to Jesus?&rdquo;&nbsp; She answered, &ldquo;I would rather 
die and go to Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her death very much affected her 
grandmother.&nbsp; She would not leave the corpse, which she often 
affectionately embraced, till persuaded she would endanger her own 
life.&nbsp; This appeared a melancholy event to all who wished well to the 
Gipsies in the neighbourhood of Southampton.&nbsp; For the widow, fearing 
her child would become ill and die too, immediately removed her from the 
school.&nbsp; And many of the Gipsy people treated the women with great 
contempt, for giving up their children; and the prospects of doing them 
lasting good, became very much beclouded.&nbsp; It was however represented 
to them, that God was doing all things for the best, and their spirits were
soothed; and in consequence, the little fatherless girl was again brought 
to the school.</p>
<p>After this event, the women remained a considerable time in the 
neighbourhood, waiting to see if the little one, again given up to the 
author, would be kindly treated.&nbsp; By this detention they were often 
brought into the company of good people, whose kindness gained their 
confidence.&nbsp; They began to listen to invitations to settle in the 
town, and finally determined <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>on doing so.&nbsp; Even the <i>old</i> woman, 
who had lived under hedges for fifty years, and who had declared but a 
short time before, that she would not leave her tent for a palace, now 
gladly occupied a house; this greatly encouraged their friends, who well 
knew that it was not a small sacrifice, for a Gipsy to give up what is 
thought by them to be their liberty.</p>
<p>A short time before these women removed from under the hedges, the 
sister of the unhappy man who had been executed, came out of Dorsetshire 
with her three children, on her way to Surry, where she had been accustomed
to go to hop-picking.&nbsp; Encamping under the same hedge with the widow 
and her aunt, she was seen by the author in one of his visits to 
them.&nbsp; He found them one evening about six o&rsquo;clock at dinner, 
and took his seat near them; and while they were regaling themselves with 
broiled meat, potatoes, and tea, the following interesting conversation 
took place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the widow, &ldquo;this is my sister and her 
children.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one could have introduced this woman and her 
little ones with more easy simplicity than she did, while, by the smile on 
her swarthy countenance, she exhibited real heartfelt pleasure.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I am glad to see you, my good woman;&rdquo; said the author, 
&ldquo;are these your children?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; 
replied she, very cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;And where are you 
going?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am going into Surry, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Have you not many difficulties to trouble you in your way of 
life?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered she.&nbsp; The author 
continued, &ldquo;I wish you would let me have your children to provide for
and <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>educate.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not I, indeed,&rdquo; she replied 
sharply; &ldquo;others may part with their children, if they like, but I 
will never part with mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, my good woman, the 
offer to educate them has done no harm: let me hope it will do good.&nbsp; 
I would have you recollect that you have now a proposal made you of 
bettering their present and future condition.&nbsp; You and I must soon 
meet at the judgment-seat of Christ, to give an account of this meeting; 
and you know that I can do better for your little ones than you 
can.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was silent.&nbsp; The author then addressed these 
people and left the tents.</p>
<p>The next day he visited the camp again, when the widow woman said, 
&ldquo;Sir, my sister was so <i>cut up</i> (putting her hand to her heart),
with what you said last night, that she could not eat any more, and 
declared she felt as she never had done before; and she has determined to 
come and live with us at Michaelmas.&rdquo;&nbsp; What was still better, in
consequence of what was said to this poor stranger, she did not go to the 
races, although she had stopped near Southampton for that purpose.</p>
<p>From this time endeavours were made to confirm the woman&rsquo;s 
intentions to stay at Southampton, and to place her children with the 
other.&nbsp; She was asked, why she would not stay at Southampton 
then?&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for 
it&rsquo;s no use to tell a lie about that, I don&rsquo;t want to bring my 
children to you, like vagabonds; and as we shall earn a good <i>bit</i> of 
money at hopping, I shall buy them some clothes; <!-- page 69--><a 
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and then, if you will 
take me a room at Michaelmas, I will surely return and live in Southampton,
and my children shall go to school; but I will never give them up 
entirely.&rdquo;&nbsp; She continued with her sister till the house which 
had been taken for the latter was ready; during which time a gentleman from
Ireland, then living near the encampment, had her children every day to his
house, and taught them to read.&nbsp; The remembrance of him will be 
precious to them for ever.&nbsp; She came on the day appointed, and her 
children were put to the Infants&rsquo; School, where they have continued 
ever since, clean and respectable, and very diligent in their 
learning.&nbsp; They often explain the Scriptures to their mother.&nbsp; 
One of them has long been a monitor in the school.&nbsp; May she continue a
credit to the institution in which she has been so far educated.</p>
<p>Although the mother of these children is not yet decidedly pious, she is
very much improved.&nbsp; She is now able to read her Testament with 
tolerable ease, takes great pleasure in receiving instruction, and we hope 
is deeply impressed with the importance of personal religion.&nbsp; She 
attends public worship diligently, and loves Christians, whom she once 
hated.&nbsp; She weeps with abhorrence over past crimes, and says she would
rather have her hands cut off, than do as she has done.&nbsp; For more than
twelve months after living at Southampton, she continued occasionally to 
tell fortunes for the gain it brought her.&nbsp; But a remarkable dream led
her to see the wickedness of this practice; for it so terrified <!-- page 
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>her that she 
rose from her bed, lighted a fire, and burnt the book in which she had 
pretended to see the fortune of others.&nbsp; Large sums of money had been 
offered her for this volume; but, though in extreme poverty, she determined
to make any sacrifice, rather than enrich herself by its sale.&nbsp; She 
dreamed that she was at the adult school, where she regularly attended, 
and, that while she was reading her Testament, it changed into a book of 
divination, and she began to tell the fortune of the lady who was teaching 
her; and while thus employed, she thought she heard awful thunderings, and 
the sound of trumpets; after which a tremendous tempest ensued, during 
which she fancied herself in an extensive plain, exposed to all the fury of
the storm.&nbsp; She then thought the day of judgment was come, and that 
she was summoned to render up her account.&nbsp; She awoke in great terror,
and as soon as she had a little recovered herself, arose and followed the 
example of those we read of in the Acts of the Apostles:&mdash;<i>And many 
of them which also used curious arts</i>, <i>brought their books 
together</i>, <i>and burned them before all men</i>; <i>and they counted 
the price of them</i>, <i>and found fifty thousand pieces silver</i>.&nbsp;
Acts xix. 19.</p>
<p>When relating this dream to a lady, she was asked whether she had 
formerly been in the habit of seeking by any means, the aid of the devil, 
in order to know future events; it having been asserted that many of the 
Gipsies had done so.&nbsp; She informed the lady that she never had done 
so, and that she thought none of <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>her people had any thing to do with him, 
otherwise than by giving themselves up to do wickedly.&nbsp; The devil 
tempted them to do still worse; as those who neglect to seek to God for 
help, must of course be under the power of the wicked one.</p>
<h2><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
72</span>CHAP. VIII.&nbsp; Of the plans pursued by the Southampton 
Committee, and the success which has attended them, continued.</h2>
<p>Sixteen reformed Gipsies are now living at Southampton, one of whom is 
the aged Gipsy whose history has been published by a lady. <a 
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72" class="citation">[72]</a>&nbsp;
There are also her brother and four of his children, her sister, who has 
been a wanderer for more than fifty years, and her daughter, three orphans,
and a boy who has been given up to the Committee by his mother, a woman and
her three children, and the young woman before mentioned, who has, since 
her reformation, lost her two children by the measles.</p>
<p>In addition to those who have retired from a wandering life, and are 
pursuing habits of honest industry, three other families, whose united 
number is sixteen, begged the privilege of wintering with us in the 
beginning of 1831.&nbsp; These Gipsies regularly attended divine service 
twice on a Sunday, and on the work-day evenings the adults went to school 
to learn to read.&nbsp; The children were placed at one of the 
Infants&rsquo; Schools.&nbsp; The prospects of doing one of the families 
lasting good, <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>are rather dark, as they are grown old and hardened in crime; but 
the condition of the others is more encouraging.&nbsp; The children, who 
would gladly have stayed longer with us, were sickly; and it is 
apprehended, had not this been the case, the parents would have continued 
longer, that they might have gone to school.&nbsp; Two women, mother and 
daughter, in one family, are much interested in the worship of God, and 
already begin to feel the value of their souls; and both regret that they 
are under the necessity of submitting to the arbitrary will of the 
father.&nbsp; One of them declared that she could never more act as a 
Gipsy, and with weeping eyes she said, that, she feared she never should be
pardoned, or saved.&nbsp; When directed to go to Jesus, she replied, she 
knew not how to go to him.&nbsp; In three days they will leave us, and it 
will be a painful separation.&nbsp; It was very gratifying to the author to
see so many Gipsies attend the house of God, and he frequently recollected 
with pleasure, that promise of holy Scripture, <i>For as the rain cometh 
down</i>, <i>and the snow from heaven</i>, <i>and returneth not 
thither</i>, <i>but watereth the earth</i>, <i>and maketh it bring forth 
and bud</i>, <i>that it may give seed to the sower</i>, <i>and bread to the
eater</i>: <i>so shall my word be that goeth forth of my mouth</i>: <i>it 
shall not return unto me void</i>, <i>but it shall accomplish that which I 
please</i>, <i>and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I send 
it</i>.&nbsp; <i>For ye shall go out with joy</i>, <i>and be led forth with
peace</i>; <i>the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
singing</i>, <i>and all the trees of the field shall clap their 
hands</i>.&nbsp; <i>Instead of the thorn shall come up the </i><!-- page 
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span><i>fur 
tree</i>, <i>and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree</i>: 
<i>and it stall be to the Lord for a name</i>, <i>for an everlasting sign 
that shall not be cut off</i>.</p>
<p>Six of the children are at an Infants&rsquo; School at Southampton, and 
three others attend a charity school; and another is learning to be a coach
wheelwright.&nbsp; This youth has behaved so well in his situation, that he
has been advanced by his master to a higher branch in the business.&nbsp; 
His fellow-workmen, who at first disliked him for being a Gipsy, have 
subscribed money to assist him in the purchase of additional tools, to 
which the foreman added five shillings, and the master <i>one 
pound</i>.&nbsp; This is a most encouraging circumstance.</p>
<p>The aged man who has been so many years reformed, is a basket 
maker.&nbsp; He often visits his brethren in their tents, under the 
direction of the Committee, to give advice and instruction.&nbsp; His 
sister, lately reclaimed, takes care of the six Gipsy children, and is 
become very serious and industrious; and though in the decline of life, she
receives but one shilling per week from the Committee.&nbsp; Two instances 
of the gratitude of this woman ought not to be omitted.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s horse having strayed from the field, a sovereign was 
offered to any one who would bring it back to him.&nbsp; Several persons 
sought for it in vain.&nbsp; This old Gipsy woman was sent in quest of it, 
and in two days returned with the horse.&nbsp; Of course she was offered 
the sovereign that had been named as a reward; but she refused to take it, 
saying, she owed the author more than that; yea, all that she had, for the 
comfort <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>she was then enjoying.&nbsp; This was the language of an honest 
and grateful heart.&nbsp; On being compelled to take it, she bought herself
some garments for the winter.</p>
<p>On another occasion, when she was coming from some place which she had 
visited, and was detained on the road longer than she had expected, she 
became penniless; yet would she not beg, lest it might be looked on as one 
step towards turning back to habits she had entirely abandoned.&nbsp; She 
assured the author that she would rather have starved than return to her 
old trade of begging; and besides, added she, &ldquo;the people know that I
am one of your reformed Gipsies, and I will never bring a reproach upon my 
best friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young widow was taught to make shoes; but becoming depressed in 
spirits after the death of her children, she has been placed in 
service.&nbsp; And another young Gipsy woman has also obtained a situation 
as a servant.</p>
<p>But while the Committee has had to rejoice over the success that has 
attended its efforts, it has also experienced great and manifold 
disappointments.&nbsp; But its members are not discouraged, and it is hoped
they never will be.</p>
<p>One young woman stayed with the Committee a month, and then ran 
away.&nbsp; She was lamentably ignorant, and could never be brought to 
work. <a name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75" 
class="citation">[75]</a>&nbsp; Another <!-- page 76--><a 
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>very promising in 
temper and habits, stayed in a family three months, and then left them to 
live again with her parents, who encouraged her to believe that she would 
be married to one of her clan.&nbsp; It may be hoped the knowledge she 
gained while in service may be useful to her at some future time.&nbsp; She
is not, cannot be happy, and is sorry that she left her service and her 
friends.&nbsp; The father and mother have promised to stay in Southampton 
through the next winter, which they will be encouraged to do, with the hope
of gaining instruction in the truths of religion.</p>
<p>A woman, her four sons, and their grandmother, <a 
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76" class="citation">[76]</a> 
joined the family of reformed Gipsies for a short time, and we had 
considerable hopes of them all, the two eldest boys excepted, who refused 
to work, and who grew much more vicious than when under the hedges.&nbsp; 
Their father had formerly been sentenced to death, but by the interest of a
friend, the sentence was changed to fourteen years&rsquo; hard labour on 
board the hulks at Portsmouth, nearly nine of which had expired at the time
his family came under the direction of the Committee.&nbsp; His wife 
intimating that if they were to apply for his release, it might be granted,
and that then he might govern the boys, and make them work, his liberty was
obtained.&nbsp; But within three days afterwards, <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>he declared he would 
not constrain any of his children to labour; they might do it or not, as 
they pleased.&nbsp; And, in the course of the week, he took them all away 
and went to Brighton.</p>
<p>A lady then staying at that place, and who had known this family at 
Southampton, sent to the place where the Gipsies usually encamp, hoping to 
recall some of them to a sense of their duty, but was informed that the 
whole of the party had set off a few days before.&nbsp; Early on the 
following morning, a Gipsy called at the house of this lady, and offered to
tell the fortunes of the servants.&nbsp; She was asked if she knew the 
woman who was enquired for the preceding day?&nbsp; She replied, that 
<i>she was the very person</i>.&nbsp; On hearing by whose servant she was 
addressed, she became almost speechless with shame, and said, <i>I would 
rather have met the king</i>.&nbsp; On recovering, she expressed great 
delight and gratitude that she was not forgotten by the lady, and declared 
she had been very unhappy since she had left Southampton, and that the sin 
of fortune-telling greatly distressed her mind; but that she knew not how 
to support her family without it.&nbsp; They had undergone many 
hardships.&nbsp; The little boys, she said, had frequently amused 
themselves with trying to spell the different things about their tent, and 
were often wishing for their Southampton fire.&nbsp; The next morning she 
brought them to see their kind benefactress.&nbsp; The youngest of them, a 
fine promising boy, both as to talent and disposition, was overjoyed at the
meeting; his little eyes were filled with tears, and he could <!-- page 
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>scarcely 
speak.&nbsp; He and his brother were immediately provided with clothing, 
and sent to the School of Industry; where, in addition to the religious 
instruction given them, they were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, 
digging, &amp;c.&nbsp; Their master has been much pleased with their 
progress.&nbsp; The mother was afterwards induced to stay at Brighton, 
being allowed a small sum weekly.&nbsp; She has been taught to read by some
kind friends, and many hopes are entertained of her conversion to 
God.&nbsp; A letter has lately been received, which gives a very 
interesting account of her increase in knowledge and improvement in 
morals.</p>
<p>A very promising Gipsy youth, who was placed with a coach-maker in 
Southampton, after working some time, cut his hand, and then relinquished 
his employment, to wander with his father, who is a rat-catcher.&nbsp; But 
it is hoped that he, as well as others of his brethren who have returned to
their former courses, will be brought back, or find some other desirable 
and permanent abode; that what has been done by this society may not 
ultimately be lost.&nbsp; Indeed, while writing this, I am happy to be able
to state, that the morals of this young man appear very correct, and that 
he has, by constant application, learned to read tolerably well since he 
left Southampton.&nbsp; He supports himself by selling brushes, lines, and 
corks, but talks very seriously of giving up his wandering habits to return
to us again.</p>
<p>Among the reclaimed Gipsies are three women who were notorious 
fortune-tellers, and who doubtless have <!-- page 79--><a 
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>done much injury to the
morals of society.&nbsp; They are now very promising; and there is a fair 
prospect of their children being saved from much sin and misery, as they 
are placed at Infants&rsquo; Schools, where they are gradually acquiring 
useful scriptural knowledge, and correctness of habits; in which, if they 
persevere, by the grace of the Redeemer, their present and everlasting 
welfare will be secured.&nbsp; Such examples of success amply repay the 
Committee for the trouble and expense already bestowed on the Gipsies; and 
it is hoped its members will be stimulated to every exertion in their power
by the good done to those in a state of reformation and improvement, that 
the whole wandering race may be led into the right way.</p>
<h2><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>CHAP. IX.&nbsp; Of the plans pursued by the Southampton Committee,
and the success which has attended them, continued.</h2>
<p>A gipsy woman, of whose reformation we have already taken some notice, 
having gone to solicit the assistance of the parish to which one of her 
children belonged, met with many difficulties and troubles.&nbsp; She was 
not at this time destitute of the knowledge of religion.&nbsp; She had 
learned to read, and had become acquainted with the Scriptures, at an adult
school, and by attending at a place of worship; and these instructions were
not thrown away on her; for although she was frequently invited to eat and 
drink in the tents of the Gipsies on her journey, she conscientiously 
refused, fearing that what they were partaking of might not be honestly 
obtained.&nbsp; She informed them that her Testament had taught her better 
habits than those she had formerly known.&nbsp; Her children helped to keep
alive her religious impressions.&nbsp; They often talked to her about the 
school from which she had taken them, of their lessons, and the 
observations of the master and mistress, on different parts of the 
Scriptures, and at other times they catechised each other on the objects 
that presented themselves on the road, in the same way they had been used 
to in the Infants&rsquo; Schools; to <!-- page 81--><a 
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>which they often begged
their mother to let them return.&nbsp; These circumstances, she has since 
said, made her so miserable that she felt she <i>could not live as she had 
done</i>.</p>
<p>Some time after this, she made a visit to a parish in which another of 
her children was born, near Basingstoke.&nbsp; She entered the cottage of 
an old couple who sold fruit, &amp;c.&nbsp; Tea being proposed, the old 
woman expressed her surprise that she had not seen her visitor for so long 
a time, saying she was glad she was come, as she wanted her to tell her 
many things, meaning future events.&nbsp; She mentioned a great deal that 
another Gipsy woman had told her, on which the reformed one 
exclaimed&mdash;<i>Don&rsquo;t believe her</i>, <i>dame</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is
all lies</i>.&nbsp; <i>She knows no more about it than you do</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>If you trust to what she says</i>, <i>you will be deceived</i>.&nbsp; 
The old woman was still more surprised, and asked <i>how she</i>, who had 
so often told their fortunes, and had promised them such good luck, could 
be so much altered?&nbsp; The woman taking her Testament from her bosom, 
replied, &ldquo;I have learned from this blessed book, and from my kind 
friends, <i>that all liars shall have their portion in the lake that 
burneth with brimstone and fire</i>; and rather than tell fortunes again, I
would starve.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then opened her book and began reading a 
chapter, endeavouring to explain as she read, at which her host and hostess
began to weep.&nbsp; She told them that though she knew she had been a 
great sinner, and was one still, yet she never had felt so happy as 
then.&nbsp; The old woman observed, that <i>she</i> could not <!-- page 
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>say <i>she was 
happy</i>, and wished to know what she must do to feel happy.&nbsp; The 
Gipsy replied, you must leave off selling on Sundays, and go to a place of 
worship, and learn to read the Testament, and to pray, and <i>then</i> you 
will become happy.</p>
<p>This poor Gipsy woman, who was so anxious to instruct those she had many
times deceived, was soon after taken sick, at which time her distress of 
soul was very great; and she then said, were she to die, her <i>soul could 
not go to heaven</i>.</p>
<p>Many were her temptations, while in great poverty, to renew the practice
of fortune-telling.&nbsp; Several genteel parties have visited her, and 
sometimes offered her gold, tempting her to begin again the sins she had 
for ever given up; but, much to her credit, she at all times resolutely 
refused all such unholy gain.</p>
<p>At one time some very gay young women called on her, desiring to have 
their fortunes told.&nbsp; Her Testament lay on the table, which she had 
but a short time before been reading, and pointing to it, she 
said&mdash;<i>That book</i>, <i>and that only</i>, <i>will tell your 
fortunes</i>; <i>for it is God&rsquo;s book</i>; <i>it is his own 
word</i>.&nbsp; She reproved them for their sin, and said, the Bible had 
told her, <i>all unrighteousness is sin</i>.&nbsp; They then requested she 
would not tell any one that they had called upon her.&nbsp; She 
replied&mdash;<i>Oh</i>! <i>you fear man more than God</i>!</p>
<p>A few days since, this reformed woman was sweeping the pavement in front
of her house, when two female servants came up, enquiring for the house of 
the fortune-teller; mourning over them for their folly, <!-- page 83--><a 
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>she said&mdash;<i>My 
dears</i>, <i>she cannot tell your fortunes</i>.&nbsp; <i>I have been a 
professed fortune-teller</i>, <i>and have deceived hundreds</i>.&nbsp; She 
succeeded in persuading them to go home.</p>
<p>At a meeting of Gipsies held at a gentleman&rsquo;s house, Jan. 1830, 
the youngest child of this woman said to her mother, <i>Mammy</i>, <i>who 
be all these folks</i>?&nbsp; The mother replied, <i>They are 
Gipsies</i>.&nbsp; <i>Was</i> I <i>ever like &rsquo;em</i>? asked the 
child.&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>, said the mother, <i>you was once a poor little 
Gipsy without stockings and shoes</i>, <i>and glad to beg a halfpenny of 
any body</i>.&nbsp; It is a circumstance not to be lamented, that the 
condition even of a little child, has been so much bettered by the 
exertions of the Committee.</p>
<p>In addition to the encouragement afforded us by this woman, giving up 
with so much decision the practice of fortune-telling, the author must not 
forget to mention an instance of her forbearance of temper under 
provocation and outrage.&nbsp; She had, when a vagrant, a quarrel with some
of her ignorant people of another tribe.&nbsp; Meeting with them after her 
reformation, she was severely beaten by them, and had her ear-drops torn 
from her ears, while they contemptuously called her <i>Methodist</i>.&nbsp;
When asked, why she did not bring her persecutors to justice, she replied, 
<i>How can I be forgiven</i>, <i>if I do not forgive</i>?&nbsp; <i>That is 
what my Testament tells me</i>.</p>
<p>The young widow we have before mentioned, continued to tell fortunes for
some time after we had taken her children; but it pleased the Holy Spirit 
to awaken <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>her conscience, and to shew her the wickedness of such crimes, by 
which she was led to true repentance and reformation of character.</p>
<p>After the death of both the children of this interesting individual, she
went into the service of a kind and pious lady in London.&nbsp; For this 
situation she was prepared by one of equal benevolence in Southampton, who 
had her for some time in her own house for that purpose.&nbsp; She 
continued in this situation till the lady&rsquo;s death, and has since been
in other service, where she has conducted herself so well as to prove she 
is become a sincere servant of Christ.</p>
<h2><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
85</span>CHAP. X.&nbsp; Some Remarks on the Sin of Fortune-telling.</h2>
<p>The author will be pardoned, he is willing to hope, by the kind reader, 
if he digress in one or two paragraphs in this part of his work, purposely 
to expose the great wickedness of prognostication and fortune-telling; as 
the whole is not only unsound, foolish, absurd and false, but is most 
peremptorily forbidden in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>In the law of Moses it is commanded, that there should not be found 
among the people, any that used divination, or that was an observer of the 
times, or that was an enchanter: Deut. xiii. 10.&nbsp; In the prophecies of
Malachi, the Lord has declared&mdash;<i>Thou shalt have no more 
soothsayers</i>: Mal. v. 12.&nbsp; Balaam and Balak were cursed of the Lord
of Hosts; the former for using enchantments, and the latter for employing 
Balaam in this wicked work.&nbsp; <i>Woe to them that devise iniquity</i>: 
Micah, ii. 1.&nbsp; Those who employ unhappy Gipsy women, should think on 
the portion of the liar; Rev. xxi. 8: for the person who tempts another to 
utter falsehood by offering rewards, is equally guilty before God.&nbsp; 
<i>A companion of fools shall be destroyed</i>: Prov. <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>xiii. 20.&nbsp; 
<i>Though hand join in hand</i>, in sin, <i>the wicked shall not go 
unpunished</i>: Prov. xvi. 5.&nbsp; <i>The destruction of the transgressors
and the sinners shall be together</i>: Isai. i. 28.&nbsp; It may be safely 
affirmed that the sin of those persons, who trifle with Gipsy women in 
having their fortunes told by them, nearly resembles that of the first king
of Israel; who, by consulting, in his trouble, a wicked woman, who 
pretended to supernatural power, filled up the measure of those sins, by 
which he lost the protection of heaven, his crown, and his life, and by 
which he involved his family in the most ruinous calamity.</p>
<p>Reader, have you encouraged any of these people in such crimes?&nbsp; If
you have so far forgotten yourselves, the commands of God, and the curse 
that awaits you and those who deceive themselves the same way; reflect, 
before it be too late, on the evil into which you have willingly, wilfully,
and without the least reasonable excuse, fallen, and on the guilt that must
of necessity attach to your consciences thereby.&nbsp; Should you never 
meet those you encouraged to sin in this world, and therefore never have an
opportunity of warning them of their danger, yet must you meet at the bar 
of Christ; and if then loaded with the weight of the sin in question, how 
awful will be your condition!&nbsp; Yourself and a fellow creature turned 
out for ever from God, and heaven, and hope!&nbsp; You may find mercy 
<i>now</i>, if you, by faith in the Redeemer, <i>seek for it</i>; and who 
can tell but if you sincerely pray for those <!-- page 87--><a 
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>you led into sin, but 
that the mercy of which you part take, may find out them!&nbsp; May it even
be so, to your everlasting comfort!</p>
<p>Some have supposed that this contemptible practice was first introduced 
into Europe by the Gipsies: but such persons are greatly mistaken.&nbsp; In
the dark ages of superstition, in which this wandering people came to our 
part of the world, prognostication and fortune-telling were carried on to 
an infinite extent; and so enraged were the deceivers of those days against
the Gipsies, that they proclaimed they knew nothing of the <i>art</i>; that
they were deceivers and impostors.</p>
<p>It were well if the Gipsies were <i>now</i> the only persons addicted to
such wickedness; but this is not the case; for it is well known that almost
every town is cursed with an astrological, magical, or slight-of-hand 
fortune-teller.&nbsp; There are two now in Southampton; and their wretched 
abodes are visited not only by vain and ignorant servants, but often by 
those who belong to the higher circles, and not unfrequently by those who 
drive their carriages.</p>
<p>To conclude this chapter, it may be safely said, that the sort of 
wickedness in question, is not only forbidden in the Scriptures, and will 
add much to the guilt of an impenitent death; but that it is calculated to 
give us the most airy anticipations, or oppress us with the most 
unreasonable despair.&nbsp; <i>Sufficient unto the day is the evil 
thereof</i>; why should we then afflict ourselves about ill-fortune in 
future years?&nbsp; If we <i>seek</i>, as the <!-- page 88--><a 
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>first great object of 
life, <i>the kingdom of heaven</i>, <i>all </i>[necessary] <i>things shall 
be added</i>.&nbsp; And why should we deceive ourselves with gay and 
splendid expectations?&nbsp; <i>Riches make themselves wings and soon fly 
away</i>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
89</span>CHAP. XI.&nbsp; Plans suggested to the pious and benevolent for 
promoting a Reformation among the Gipsies.</h2>
<p>As no event happens without a cause, so no good is accomplished without 
means.&nbsp; It is in the power of man as an instrument, frequently to make
his fellow-creatures either happy or miserable.&nbsp; And it may safely be 
asserted, that much of the ignorance, depravity, and consequent misery 
found in the world, are occasioned by the want of a united and persevering 
application of the energies of Christians, to the reformation of the most 
debased classes of Society.&nbsp; This backwardness to perform that which 
is good, with respect to our fellow men, must be accounted for, by the want
of faith in God&rsquo;s word, and the little influence we allow the 
religion of the Saviour to have on our own hearts.&nbsp; It may also be 
occasioned by the strong evidences we have of the corruption of human 
nature, and the little good we see attend the labours of others: and we are
often likewise discouraged because our own efforts fail.&nbsp; On these 
accounts, how often do we sigh for opportunities of doing good, whilst we 
neglect the openings of Providence in little things, which would frequently
lead to the accomplishment of most important usefulness.&nbsp; Dr Johnson 
used to say, <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>&ldquo;He who waits to do a great deal of good at once, will never
do any.&rdquo;&nbsp; Good is done by degrees.&nbsp; However small in 
proportion the benefit which follows <i>individual attempts</i> to do good,
a great deal may thus be accomplished by perseverance, even in the midst of
discouragements and disappointments.&nbsp; The first missionaries who 
visited England, had to contend with all the frightful cruelties of savage 
life, and the more horrid rites of Druidical worship.&nbsp; But now, though
much wickedness abounds in England, it is, in a religious point of view, 
the paradise of the earth.&nbsp; May all those who wish to diffuse the 
genuine influences of Christianity among the poor Gipsies, imitate the 
example of the adorable Saviour, who <i>made himself of no reputation</i>, 
that he might enlighten the most ignorant, and impart happiness to the most
miserable.</p>
<p>It will not be denied that the Gipsies are capable of feeling the 
influence, and appreciating the worth of the Gospel: and no one will doubt 
that the earlier the plans are adopted for their improvement, the sooner 
will this desirable work be accomplished.</p>
<p>The reader is requested to pay particular attention to the following 
suggestions.</p>
<p>The establishment of an Institution to supply instruction to the Gipsies
by regular Ministers, or Missionaries, would be of but little use.&nbsp; 
Indeed such a measure could scarcely be carried into effect.&nbsp; For the 
Gipsies, beside associating in very small companies, are perpetually driven
from place to place.&nbsp; To supply them, therefore, with regular 
instruction, a preacher <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>would be necessary to every family; who would 
condescend to their mode of life, travel when they travelled, rest when 
they rested, and be content with the ground and straw for his bed, and a 
blanket tent for his covering!&nbsp; All this would subject them to great 
personal inconvenience, and at the same time be very expensive and highly 
improper.&nbsp; Neither would it be possible for ministers to be appointed 
occasionally and alternately to visit the Gipsies in different 
counties.&nbsp; For it might often happen that, before intelligence could 
be forwarded to those appointed to give them instruction, they might be 
removed by a peace officer, or have set out on a journey of several miles 
distance.&nbsp; Benevolent, zealous, and prudent persons may do much by 
visiting the camps near towns; and the most suitable parts of the day for 
promoting this object, are morning and evening.&nbsp; But the most simple 
and easy plans of instruction should invariably be adopted.</p>
<p>To those persons who are afraid of visiting the Gipsies, lest they 
should be insulted, abused, and robbed, the author may be allowed to say 
that they have not the least grounds for such fears.&nbsp; In Scotland this
fear is quite as general among the religious people as it is in England; 
and in that country the inhabitants are even afraid to prosecute them for 
their depredations and crimes.&nbsp; In England ladies are frequently known
to visit their camps singly, when more than a mile from towns, and to sit 
and read and converse with them for a considerable time, with the greatest 
confidence and safety.</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>There is not the least prospect of doing them good, by forcing 
instruction upon them.&nbsp; About the year 1748, the Empress Theresa 
attempted the improvement of the Gipsies in Germany, by taking away, by 
force, all their children of a certain age, in order to educate and protect
them; but such an unnatural and arbitrary mode of benevolence, defeated its
own object; and this is not to be wondered at: the souls of the free resist
every effort of compulsion, whether the object be good or bad.&nbsp; 
Compulsatory instruction, therefore, would do no good among the 
Gipsies.&nbsp; But they are easily won by kindness, and whoever wishes 
really to benefit them, must convince them that this is his intention, by 
patiently bearing with the unpleasing parts of their characters, and by a 
willingness to lessen their distresses so far as it is in his power.&nbsp; 
Such kindness will never be lost upon them.&nbsp; Nor would the author 
recommend their being encouraged to live in Towns, except they are truly 
desirous of leading a new life, as it is almost certain that their morals 
would be greatly corrupted thereby: and they would be capable of more 
extensive injury to society, should they take to their wandering habits 
again.</p>
<p>A correspondent of a friend of the author, has just communicated the 
following particulars, which prove the truth of the above remarks.</p>
<p>There is in the neighbourhood of Harz, at Nordausen, a colony of 
Gipsies, to whom a Missionary has been sent from Berlin.&nbsp; His last 
letter speaks very favourably of their disposition to receive the word of 
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>life.&nbsp; The manner of his introduction to them was by no means
likely to ensure him a favourable reception.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said
the person who brought him among them, &ldquo;you have a Missionary, who is
come to convert you; now mind and be converted, or you shall go to 
prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; The effect this foolish speech produced on the Gipsies
may be easily imagined, and likewise how useless it rendered the situation 
of the Missionary who desired to labour among them.&nbsp; They took to 
flight whenever they saw him approach, and thus, humanly speaking, there 
appeared not the least prospect of success, as the seed of the word could 
not so much as be sown.&nbsp; But <span class="smcap">He</span>, who alone 
is able to turn the heart, mercifully looked upon the work, and directed 
him to the right means effectually to bring it about.</p>
<p>The Gipsies were obliged to cultivate the land on which they were 
permitted to reside; but being quite ignorant of agriculture, they were at 
a loss how to proceed.&nbsp; The missionary undertook himself to give them 
advice and assistance in the work.&nbsp; Seeing the success that attended 
his labours, they began to be much more diligent in the cultivation of 
their grounds, while their confidence daily increased in their missionary, 
and they became more accessible and willing to be taught.&nbsp; At last 
they asked him for what reason the people at Berlin had sent him among 
them? and when he told them, they were overpowered with gratitude, and 
melted into tears.&nbsp; Their attachment to him and the friends who had 
sent him, became stronger and stronger.&nbsp; In some cases, it may be 
true, the conquest of their <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>prejudices against the missionary, might 
proceed from the advantages they reaped by attending to his advice; and 
this is much to their credit, and is a most desirable improvement.&nbsp; It
is hoped they will soon be led to attend sincerely to his religious 
instructions.</p>
<p>A gentleman resident in one of the towns of Hampshire, was agreeably 
surprised one sabbath morning, by seeing a number of Gipsies at public 
worship; and on being induced to converse with them, was pleased to find 
that they regularly attended divine service at Southampton, and other 
places.&nbsp; He directed them to move their tents into a more commodious 
situation in one of his own fields.&nbsp; This unusual act of kindness, 
which however required no great sacrifice on his part, made so deep an 
impression on the hearts of this people, as is not likely to be forgotten: 
they will speak of his kindness as long as they live.&nbsp; This, as well 
as the instances we have mentioned already in this work, and many more 
which we may not notice, shew that we are not without opportunities of 
observing their gratitude for those favours that have been bestowed upon 
them.</p>
<p>They receive with willingness one of their own people, who is now a 
reformed and pious character, living at Southampton, and whom we have named
in a former page.&nbsp; They now rejoice, too, in the assurance that a 
great number of good Christians pity and love them, and are seeking to 
promote their present and everlasting happiness.</p>
<p>It is therefore much to be wished, that committees of <!-- page 95--><a 
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>ladies or gentlemen 
were formed in every town in the kingdom, and their attention directed to 
this neglected class of British subjects.&nbsp; An active person might be 
found in every place, to act under the sanction of such committees, who 
should visit their tents, instruct them in the Scriptures, and pray with 
and for them (the latter he should never neglect) by which means he would 
gain their confidence, and would always be looked on as a friend.&nbsp; 
Such a person should not be ashamed to speak kindly to them when he meets 
them in the street, or on the road.&nbsp; Indeed at all times he should 
converse with them plainly and affectionately about the great love of the 
Redeemer, in coming into this our world, to suffer and die for guilty 
sinners, of whom they make a number.&nbsp; But all the labour should not be
confined to one person.&nbsp; Every member of these committees should be 
alive to this good work; as also all Christians, and especially 
ministers.</p>
<p>But should there not be sufficient energy and benevolence in all towns 
to form a committee, two or three who are well disposed to the object, may 
unite together and accomplish a great deal.&nbsp; And should there not be 
found more than one person thus benevolently disposed, let not that one be 
discouraged.&nbsp; The single talent must not be neglected, should it be 
only the power to give a cup of cold water, or to speak one word about the 
water of life to a necessitous and perishing Gipsy; for it may not, cannot 
be in vain.&nbsp; Reader, are you doing what you can in this humble 
way?&nbsp; It may be, you would rather ascend the pulpit and preach <!-- 
page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>to 
well-informed Christians, or visit the ignorant in your own town!&nbsp; 
This is well; but the other should not be left undone.&nbsp; The wanderers 
in the wilderness are not to be forgotten; the outcasts of society are to 
be sought after.&nbsp; Let us imitate our adorable Redeemer, <i>who went 
about doing good</i>, and who sought those who were not the least desirous 
of finding him.&nbsp; As an encouragement to British Christians, who are 
alive to the happiness of the Gipsies, they should know that there are many
among them desirous of a new mode of life, as will appear by an application
lately made to the author.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am unwilling to let a parcel go to Southampton, without sending

enquiry if she had called on the friends to whom I directed her?&nbsp; This
was done by her; but she could obtain no employment.&nbsp; Both H--- and

you should think me too busy; but necessity has compelled me to do

the man and woman at my house.&nbsp; After having heard H--- read, I told

influence.&rsquo;&nbsp; She exclaimed, <i>dear me</i>! <i> I never heard

she appeared struck with her own extreme ingratitude.&nbsp; Her expressions
were so simple and full of pathos, that my heart was quite overcome.&nbsp; 
She ran out of the room for her husband, and on her return, said, 
&ldquo;ah! <i>do talk</i> to my poor husband, just what you said to 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I found him not so interesting, but desirous of leaving 
his wandering life for ever, and get employment if possible.&nbsp; They 
have made some flower baskets for me; and hoping they may obtain orders for
more, I have recommended them to my friends.&nbsp; I have heard of another 
family, consisting of fourteen souls, who encamp on Bedminster Down, and 
there by God&rsquo;s help, I intend to send a minister of Jesus, to try 
what can be done for them.&nbsp; There is also another family expected, who
have a house of <i>their own</i> at <!-- page 99--><a

winter there.&nbsp; Should the Lord bless our humble endeavours, we must 
have a regular Committee, and set about our work in a workman-like manner; 
nothing short of a Colony will satisfy me.&nbsp; I intend to introduce this
interesting subject at a party this evening, and hope the Lord will open 
the hearts of his people, to do good to those poor benighted 
wanderers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The author has also just received from a clergyman in Scotland, a most 
interesting account of a colony of Gipsies in that country, where, I am 
happy to observe, they do not seem so much hunted as in England.&nbsp; And 
as the severity of their winters drive them into houses for three months, 
during that season, there is offered a fair opportunity to both ministers 
and kindly disposed Christians to do them good.&nbsp; The letter alluded to
is most gladly inserted with the view to encourage the Christian 
denominations of England to imitate the benevolence, zeal, and industry of 
their much respected brethren the Scotch.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Yetholm Hall</i>, <i>Dec.</i> 
11<i>th</i>, 1830.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the report of the Society for ameliorating the condition 
of that unfortunate race, the Gipsies, I am acquainted with your name, and 
with your benevolent exertions in their behalf.&nbsp; As the minister of a 
parish in which perhaps the largest colony of this people in Scotland 
reside, and naturally, therefore, very <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>much interested in 
any plan that promises to improve their condition, I take the liberty of 
writing you; not so much for the purpose of answering the numerous queries 
subjoined to the report, as of requesting your advice and opinion, with 
regard to what plan might be adopted for the improvement of the colony, 
placed, in some degree, under my care and superintendence.&nbsp; I have but
lately been called to the ministerial office, and appointed to the pastoral
care of this parish; and previous to the period of my appointment, I had no
opportunity of being acquainted with the character and habits of the 
Gipsies.&nbsp; Your longer acquaintance with this people, and experience, 
may suggest to me some useful hints on the subject, should you take the 
trouble to notice this letter.&nbsp; The number of Gipsies in the parish of
Yetholm is about 100.&nbsp; You are no doubt already in some degree 
acquainted with the Gipsies of Kirk Yetholm, from the interesting notices 
furnished by Mr Smith, of Kelso, and published in <span 
class="smcap">Hoyland&rsquo;s Survey</span>, and in one of the earliest 
numbers of Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine.&nbsp; And his account of them is 
substantially correct to this day.&nbsp; It would appear that the Gipsy 
population of this place is fluctuating.&nbsp; In 1798, there were only 
59.&nbsp; In 1818, when Mr Smith wrote, there were 109.&nbsp; In 1830, 
there are 100.&nbsp; And in a few years more, this number may be 
considerably diminished or increased.&nbsp; The greater part of them are 
&ldquo;muggers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;potters,&rdquo; who carry earthen-ware 
about the country for sale.&nbsp; There are two horn spoon makers; all the 
others are abroad from their head <!-- page 101--><a 
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>quarters, of Kirk 
Yetholm, from eight to nine months in the year.&nbsp; The history of some 
of the individuals and families of the clan, would furnish something very 
interesting.&nbsp; One of the family of the Taa&rsquo;s is still 
denominated the &ldquo;King.&rdquo;&nbsp; The number of children belonging 
to each family is generally large.&nbsp; There may be thirty children under
twelve years of age.&nbsp; The parents express themselves very anxious that
their children should be educated, and are willing, for this purpose, to 
leave them at home all the summer; and farther, that they should be trained
to some occupation different from their own.&nbsp; Many of the parents 
declare, that they would willingly remain at home, could they be supplied 
with constant employment.&nbsp; Of late, the greater number of them have 
occasionally attended church, and some of them continue to attend most 
regularly when at home.&nbsp; A considerable number of the younger children
also, when at home, attend our Sabbath School.&nbsp; I have likewise 
assisted the parents to send most of their children to the Day School: 
still, however, these children are at home scarcely three months in the 
depth of winter.&nbsp; Several families have not returned yet.&nbsp; Their 
education, therefore, even were they sent regularly to school, during this 
time, would be very limited.&nbsp; And besides, by attending the parents to
the country, they contract an attachment to their loose, wandering life, 
which must tend to perpetuate the peculiarities of the tribe.&nbsp; A few 
weeks ago I was requested by Dr Baird, the Principal of the University, and
one of the ministers of Edinburgh, to write <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>out a pretty full 
account of these my parishioners.&nbsp; This I have done.&nbsp; The 
account, however, was written so hastily, that I had not time even to 
correspond with you on the subject, before doing so, as my object in 
writing to you was chiefly to propose some plan which might be adopted for 
their improvement, on which you might give me some useful 
information.&nbsp; In this account, I have proposed that a fund or 
subscription should be raised for the purpose of keeping the children at 
home during those months their parents are traversing the country, for 
paying their school wages, and, if possible, for giving a salary to a 
teacher to superintend their education, and that a small additional sum be 
occasionally in readiness for paying an apprentice-fee with the boys.&nbsp;
This account may probably be published.&nbsp; I am in hopes, also, that the
Principal will interest himself in the cause.&nbsp; Should the account be 
published, the proof-sheet may be sent down to me, ere long, in which case 
I should wish to hear from you before that time, as I may have then an 
opportunity of supplying any hint, or otherwise altering the plan proposed,
from your kind communication.&nbsp; The sum which I conceived would be 
required for the purpose was about a hundred pounds per annum.&nbsp; Mr 
B---, of Killau, with whom, I believe, we both have the pleasure of being 
acquainted, has more than once wished me to open a correspondence with you 
on this subject.&nbsp; He also is interested in the cause, and promises to 
use his influence with others.&nbsp; I think he told me that some more 
detailed account of your plan was <!-- page 103--><a 
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>published, or 
preparing for the press, in which various alterations and improvements had 
been made.&nbsp; This was an additional reason for my wishing to hear from 
you, before submitting to the people of Scotland any plan on the 
subject.&nbsp; I should wish to know how the cause prospers with you, and 
what number you have at present under your care.&nbsp; I am extremely 
interested for this unfortunate people, and any information therefore with 
regard to what is doing elsewhere, would be acceptable.&nbsp; May He 
prosper the cause, whose blessing alone can render our labours 
effectual!</p>
<p>I remain, my dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">With much respect and esteem,<br />
Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">John Baird</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;P. S.&mdash;I have just received a letter from Principal Baird, 
informing me that my account of the Gipsies of Kirk Yetholm, will be 
published, and a proof for correction be sent to me shortly.&nbsp; It will 
be published in a new statistical account of Scotland, which will ensure 
for it a very extensive circulation, especially among the ministers of the 
established church of Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another letter relating to the Gipsies of Yetholm, has been received 
from the same clergyman, extracts of which may be seen in the Appendix.</p>
<h2><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
104</span>CHAP. XII.&nbsp; Plans suggested to the pious and benevolent, for
promoting a Reformation among the Gipsies, continued.</h2>
<p>It is usual, in Southampton, for a few pence to be given to a child who 
informs any of the members of the Committee when a family of Gipsies begin 
to erect their tents on the common, that they may immediately be visited by
our Reader.&nbsp; This may be done elsewhere.&nbsp; It may be well, too, to
buy a basket, or any other article they may honestly have to dispose of, 
when opportunity offers; but it is not well to bestow money on them, unless
in sickness or want.&nbsp; When their wives are confined, a favourable 
opportunity offers to bring into action the sympathies of compassion in 
other females; and what gratitude would such an instance of tenderness 
beget!&nbsp; These poor women have frequently been heard to exclaim, while 
tears filled their eyes, <i>How kind</i>, <i>how good to us</i>! for 
favours very much less!</p>
<p>The author has seldom met with instances of ingratitude, though he is 
obliged to record one.&nbsp; He was interested in the reformation of a 
Gipsy family that encamped, a short time since, about five miles from 
Southampton, whom he visited early on a Monday morning.&nbsp; Reaching the 
camp, accompanied by the <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>old Gipsy he has often mentioned in the course
of this work, he said to them, &ldquo;Since you would not come to see me, I
am come to see you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The camp, consisting of eight persons, 
gave him a cordial reception, the husband excepted, who said, he did not 
want his company.&nbsp; &ldquo;You certainly do not mean what you 
say,&rdquo; said his friend; to which he ungratefully replied, &ldquo;I 
never speak words without meaning.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a good-natured way he 
was questioned as to the truth of his being a Gipsy, accompanied with the 
remark, that Gipsies were seldom ungrateful for the favours which were 
shown them.&nbsp; In half an hour after, he left the camp very 
angrily.&nbsp; This man had been released from many years&rsquo; 
imprisonment, through the author&rsquo;s intercession; but having 
associated with thieves so long, the worst principles of his heart were 
drawn forth.&nbsp; Before he left the camp, he said he had no care about 
his children, but to feed and clothe them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you only treat
your children as a man does his dogs and pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, 
that &ldquo;such treatment was good enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a common 
sentiment; for the generality of parents have no further care about their 
children than to feed and clothe them.&nbsp; Such persons are not perhaps 
aware how nearly they come to that dreadful state of mind and heart, of 
which this ungrateful Gipsy so wickedly boasted.</p>
<p>After he had left the party, those who remained attended to conversation
and prayer, when one of the women wept bitterly on account of her sin of 
fortune-telling.&nbsp; The author has since been informed that this <!-- 
page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>poor 
man expresses his sorrow for his uncalled-for behaviour.</p>
<p>The plans adopted in Southampton, for the conversion of the Gipsies in 
Hampshire, are now generally known among their people.&nbsp; Not long ago, 
an old woman brought four orphans of a deceased relative from a great 
distance, in order to place them under the care of the Committee.&nbsp; On 
this occasion the old woman thus addressed the author.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
Mr Crabb?&rdquo;&nbsp; Being told, yes, she continued&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Chas.
Stanley, a Gipsey, desired me to bring you these poor orphans.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The author being assured that they were orphans, promised, after some 
conversation, to visit their tent the following day.&nbsp; He did so, and 
never can he forget the distressing scene he then witnessed.&nbsp; It was 
winter, and the weather was unusually cold, there being much snow on the 
ground.&nbsp; The tent, which was only covered with a <i>ragged</i> 
blanket, was pitched on the lee side of a <i>small</i> hawthorn bush.&nbsp;
The children had stolen a few <i>green</i> sticks from the hedges, but they
would not burn.&nbsp; <i>There was no straw</i> in the tent, and only one 
blanket to lay betwixt six children and the frozen ground, with nothing to 
cover them.&nbsp; The youngest of these children was three, and the eldest,
seventeen years old.&nbsp; In addition to this wretchedness, the smaller 
children were nearly naked.&nbsp; The youngest was squatted on the ground, 
her little feet and legs bare, and gnawing a frozen turnip, which had been 
stolen from an adjoining field.&nbsp; None of them had tasted bread for 
more than a day.&nbsp; The moment they <!-- page 107--><a 
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>saw their visitor, 
the little ones repeatedly shouted, &ldquo;Here is the <i>gemman come for 
us</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Some money was given to the oldest sister to buy bread
with, at which their joy was greatly increased.&nbsp; Straw was also 
provided for them to sleep on, four were measured for clothes, and, after a
few days, they were placed under the care of one of our reformed 
Gipsies.&nbsp; The youngest child died, however, a short time after, in 
consequence of having been so neglected in infancy.</p>
<p>The children were cleanly washed and newly clothed, before they were 
removed from the common.&nbsp; Perhaps they had never been thoroughly 
washed before.&nbsp; The oldest sister would not give up her wandering 
habits; and the oldest boy chose to go back to the camp again; so that the 
Committee had soon only three of them in charge.&nbsp; And these were so 
filthy in their habits for a long time, that it was very disagreeable to be
near them.&nbsp; It is hoped that, though they have lost their earthly 
parents, they may be led, through this event, to God their heavenly 
Father.&nbsp; These children were soon baptized, and two of them are 
improving at one of the Infants&rsquo; Schools.</p>
<p>A short account of their parents may not be out of place here.&nbsp; The
mother was a great fortune-teller and swindler.&nbsp; She once robbed a 
poor shepherd in Dorsetshire of twenty pounds, by promising to fill his box
with money.&nbsp; Their father was a most depraved character.&nbsp; Their 
life and practices are well described in the language of the Apostle, 
<i>Let us eat and drink</i>, <i>for to morrow we die</i>.&nbsp; 1 Cor. xv. 
32.&nbsp; The man was the <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>buffoon of their company, and became more 
depraved every year.&nbsp; They often had a great deal of money, which was,
no doubt, obtained through dishonest means.&nbsp; On one occasion, he and 
many other Gipsies, entered the parlour of a small public house on the 
borders of Hants, when emptying the contents of a dirty purse into an 
half-pint cup, he nearly filled it with sovereigns; and declared, they 
would not leave the house, till they had spent it all.&nbsp; His wife, at 
this time, who was intoxicated, was robbed of all the money she had got 
from the poor credulous shepherd, excepting one pound.</p>
<p>The same man once put 150 sovereigns into his kettle, to treat himself 
with what he called, <i>gold water</i>, for his tea; a piece of folly and 
wickedness only equalled by a fact with which the author is well 
acquainted, when an old man had his gold put under his pillow, and often 
shown to him, when he was dying.&nbsp; We need not wonder, therefore, that 
the children of this Gipsy couple should be so ignorant, depraved, and 
destitute.&nbsp; For money that is ill-gotten, and squandered in 
extravagance, entails a double curse on the parties concerned.&nbsp; But to
return to the subject of this chapter.</p>
<p>To visit the Gipsies in their tents is of great importance.&nbsp; 
Clergymen of the Establishment, dissenting ministers, and home 
missionaries, have at various times done this, and conversed freely with 
them on the Christian religion; and it has <i>not been in vain</i>.&nbsp; 
Indeed, nothing that is done, through Jesus Christ, purposely <!-- page 
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>to please 
God, and benefit the wretched, can fail to produce a good effect.&nbsp; The
Rev. Messrs Hyatt and Cobbin, who were deputed by the Home Missionary 
Society, to visit many parts of England, to enquire into the condition of 
this people, had no doubt, but that much good may be done among them, if 
proper means are pursued.&nbsp; It has many times been proved, that to 
attempt to raise them in society, without the influence of religious 
instruction, would be improper.&nbsp; They have not sufficient principles 
of honesty, nor purity of conduct, till they are taught those principles, 
and changed, by religion.&nbsp; One, among several instances, may be 
named.</p>
<p>A young female Gipsy, remarkable for the beauty of her person, was much 
noticed by a lady of rank.&nbsp; She was made to sit many times for her 
portrait, was introduced into the drawing-room, and became of consequence 
as one of the family.&nbsp; She might have done well, had she not given up 
all her prospects by running away with a Gipsy youth, for whom she had an 
attachment, and with whom she has ever since lived in great misery.&nbsp; 
If less attention had been paid to her beauty, and more to the cultivation 
of right principles, she might now have been reformed, religious, and 
happy.</p>
<p>To those who wish to forward the instruction of the children of these 
wanderers, which is of vast importance, the use of tins with letters and 
monosyllables stamped upon them, is recommended.&nbsp; A little ink or 
paint will be necessary to make the letters visible.&nbsp; <!-- page 
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>This plan 
would save much expense, and render elementary books unnecessary.&nbsp; 
They could not be torn, as books generally are.&nbsp; The pieces thrown 
away by the tinman, if the corners were taken off, would answer every 
purpose.&nbsp; To induce those children, who cannot be got from the tent, 
to learn from these tins, the visitor might promise them an old garment, or
some other trifle.&nbsp; Should the Gipsies conduct themselves properly, 
when thus visited, a little willow-wood may be given them to encourage them
in industry, and forward the manufactory of baskets.&nbsp; And it might be 
well were a small piece of ground devoted to the growth of willows, in 
neighbourhoods frequented by them, on purpose to encourage them 
thereby.&nbsp; It might be adviseable, too, to give them testimonials on a 
card, of good conduct, when about to remove to another district, which 
might serve as an introduction to benevolent persons, and those interested 
in their welfare in other places; and this means would effectually prevent 
all imposition, keep up the attention of the good among them, and would 
constantly bring them before the notice of christian society.&nbsp; Such 
kindness would be felt by the Gipsies, and, in time, might produce a good 
effect.&nbsp; This method has been attended to by the Southampton 
Committee.</p>
<p>The great object that Christians should have in view, should be to 
instruct them in the blessed truths of the Christian religion, imbue them 
with a happy sense of honesty and morality, and then reclaim them wholly 
from their unsettled and wandering habits; for <!-- page 111--><a 
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>until they have some 
knowledge of religion, and some anxiety to reform, they would only be worse
by being brought constantly before the bad examples that would be set them 
in towns.&nbsp; Of course, such a change <i>cannot be fully accomplished in
the present generation</i>; it cannot be expected.&nbsp; But their 
conversion to God will wholly be accomplished in time, if all Christians do
their duty, depending on the influence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>From what has been said in this chapter, it will appear, that, visiting 
their tents to pray for, and instruct them, teaching such children to read 
as cannot get to public schools, and prevailing on all who are able to do 
so, to attend public worship; are the principal things to be attempted, in 
this great and good undertaking.&nbsp; Those Christians who wish for 
opportunities of doing good to the Gipsies in and about London, will find 
many of them in the suburbs in the months of April, May, and June, when 
they generally find work in the market gardens.&nbsp; In the months of July
and August they move into Sussex and Kent, and are engaged in the 
harvest.&nbsp; And in the month of September, <i>great numbers</i> of them 
are to be found in the hop-districts of Kent, Sussex and Surry, where they 
find employment.&nbsp; During the winter, many of them settle in London, 
Westminster, Bristol, and other large towns, when a good opportunity is 
presented for teaching, both to the children and adults of this class, the 
elements of reading, and the principles of true religion.&nbsp; For the 
information of those who may wish to visit the Gipsies <!-- page 112--><a 
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>in London and 
Bristol, during the winter, the author thinks it his duty to name the 
streets where they generally reside.</p>
<p>Tottenham-court Road; Battle Bridge; Paddington; Bolton Street; Church 
Lane; Church Street; Kent Street, Borough; New Street; White Street; 
Banbridge Street; Shore-ditch; Tothill-fields; and Tunbridge Street.&nbsp; 
In Bristol they are principally found in Saint Phillip&rsquo;s, 
Newfoundland Street, Bedminster, and at the March and September fairs.</p>
<p>At the Ascot and Epsom races, they may be met in large numbers; and if a
benevolent, kind, and zealous minister of Christ were to visit them at 
their encampments at these seasons, and explain to them the facts, 
doctrines, and blessings of the Gospel, much good might be done.&nbsp; The 
morning would be the happiest time to visit these Gipsies, as they are too 
often at races, inebriated before night.&nbsp; It is presumed little could 
be said to profit them in a state of intoxication, and many of the women 
are then employed either in swindling or fortune-telling.</p>
<p>Should the sympathies of the British public be efficiently directed to 
the Gipsies of this country, it may call forth the zeal of other nations to
improve their still more degraded condition on the Continent, where more 
than half a million of them wander, ignorant as the heathens of all that is
necessary to salvation.&nbsp; Those of this country loudly call upon us for
instruction, which may easily be given them.&nbsp; Let all who have either 
time, money, or ability, give a helping hand; <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>and, above all, 
assist by their unfeigned and earnest prayers.&nbsp; It may be very 
advisable to pray publicly for them in places of worship, and at the family
altar, after visiting them in the highways and hedges.&nbsp; It might 
impress those of them who attend, with a grateful sense of the gracious 
care of God, and lead Christian congregations to think more of them, and to
do more for them.&nbsp; May the merciful God of heaven and of earth, hasten
the happy period, when the Gipsies of this, and of all other countries, 
shall embrace, and love, and be obedient to the Gospel of the gracious 
Redeemer!</p>

114</span>CHAP. XIII.&nbsp; Further Account of encouraging interviews with 
Gipsies, and interesting Correspondence.</h2>
<p>The author laments that he has passed so many years of his life wholly 
careless of the Gipsies of this country.&nbsp; Having travelled many times 
through England, he has had frequent opportunities of seeing them.&nbsp; 
But, till now, he looked on their conversion as a hopeless case, and nearly
wholly neglected them.&nbsp; He has already stated the manner his attention
was first roused to consider their condition and necessities more 
particularly, and he reflects with pleasure on the kindness of Providence 
in leading him to witness those events which called for sympathy towards 
them; and on the mercy of God so apparent in blessing the labours of 
himself and others in their behalf.</p>
<p>The late Rev. Legh Richmond felt a deep interest in the conversion of 
this people.&nbsp; To awaken the sympathies and energies of his countrymen 
to that subject, he composed the following hymn on their behalf.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE GIPSIES&rsquo; PETITION.</p>
<p>Oh! ye who have tasted of mercy and love,<br />
&nbsp;  And shared in the blessings of pardoning grace;<br />
Let us the kind fruits of your tenderness prove,<br />

<p>Like you, we have lost that pure gem, which, when lost,<br />
&nbsp;  Not the mines of Golconda <a name="citation115"></a><a

To redeem it the blood of a Saviour it cost:<br />
&nbsp;  Then pity, oh! pity the poor Gipsy race.</p>

&nbsp;  But he looked, and he loved, and he pitied your case;<br />
The Redeemer has cleansed you in streams of his blood;<br />
&nbsp;  Then pity, oh! pity the poor Gipsy race.</p>
<p>Ye, who have found mercy, that mercy display;<br />
&nbsp;  Ye sons of adoption, your origin trace;<br />
And then sure you cannot your face turn away,<br />

<p>That we may form part of that numerous throng,<br />
&nbsp;  Redeemed from destruction by infinite grace;<br />
And mingle with you in the heavenly song;<br />
&nbsp;  Then pity, oh! pity the poor Gipsy race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been the custom of the author to have a yearly meeting of the 
Gipsies at his own house, which is then open to all their families.&nbsp; 
Here, early in the year 1830, those who were in the lanes and on the common
near Southampton, met many of their kind and religious friends, who are 
interested in their happiness.&nbsp; The morning was agreeably spent in a 
religious service, conducted for their spiritual benefit; after which some 
attention was paid to their temporal wants.&nbsp; Forty-eight <!-- page 
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>of them, all
nearly related to each other, who were at that time assembled in the 
neighbourhood to renew their family friendships, attended on this occasion,
and were much pleased with the services in which they engaged.&nbsp; 
Different portions of the Scriptures were read and expounded to them, after
which they had a plain and familiar address.&nbsp; It was a pleasure to 
meet these people at a throne of grace.&nbsp; After partaking of bread and 
cheese and ale, during which they conducted themselves very properly, a 
blanket was presented to the proprietor of each tent, a pair of stockings 
to every individual, and a quantity of calico for changes for the 
children.&nbsp; There were thirteen reformed Gipsies among them, who spent 
the rest of the day in reading the Scriptures to their brethren at their 
own houses.</p>
<p>These people expressed themselves very gratefully.&nbsp; One of the 
families, of whom the mother could read, begged a bible.&nbsp; Some weeks 
after this bible had been given, the family was visited in its tent, when 
this copy of the Holy Scriptures was shewn to him, who observed many of the
pages doubled down to mark the passages with which the reader had been 
impressed.&nbsp; The father of the family said&mdash;&ldquo;I will never 
rest till I can read that book through.&rdquo;&nbsp; This poor man now 
attends divine service whenever he has an opportunity, although he strongly
opposed, at one time, the reading of the Scriptures in his tent.</p>
<p>A lady, who was present at this meeting, asked one of the reformed 
Gipsies, how she had felt herself <!-- page 117--><a 
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>on that 
morning?&nbsp; She replied&mdash;&ldquo;I never was so happy;&rdquo; and, 
after a short silence, continued&mdash;&ldquo;The dinner we had last year, 
was much better than that we had to-day, as it was roast beef and 
plum-pudding; but what I heard then, of the minister&rsquo;s address, was 
only the word of man to me; but to-day, it has been the word of God; I am 
sure it has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although it may be feared, that to many Gipsies then present, the 
reading of the Scriptures, and the familiar address, were only as <i>the 
words of man</i>, yet is there reason to hope they understood it, and that 
they will benefit thereby.</p>
<p>This woman had an only surviving brother who was killed in fighting, and
whose death was instantaneous.&nbsp; She was exceedingly distressed, and 
observed, in reference to this awful circumstance, &ldquo;I should not have
thought of his soul after death, at one time; but now I can read my 
Testament, I am sure that none can go to heaven but those who are born 
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she made an observation, too, of the utmost 
importance, shewing the great necessity there is for the Gipsies to be 
taught to read.&nbsp; <i>My being able to read myself</i>, said she, <i>has
a great deal more effect upon me</i>, <i>than it would if another read it 
to me</i>, <i>and I could not read</i>; <i>for now</i> <span 
class="smcap">I am sure it is in the book</span>.&nbsp; She carries her 
Testament in her pocket when she goes a journey, and reads it to her former
companions, when she meets them on the road; and if they express any wonder
at the change that has taken place, she refers them to the <!-- page 
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Scriptures 
as the cause, and her kind friends at Southampton, as the instruments.</p>
<p>The following circumstance lately occurred, and will shew the 
improvement that has taken place in her daughters.&nbsp; One of them had 
been sent by her mother to receive the weekly sum allowed her.&nbsp; On 
receiving the money, she said, &ldquo;This is twopence too much, 
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being accustomed now and then to give her a few pence 
towards buying a Testament, she was told to keep it for that purpose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have got a Testament, now, 
and mother has given her&rsquo;s to my next sister, since she has had a 
bible; and my youngest sister had a Testament given her at the Sunday 
School: but one of us is saving money to buy a hymn-book with; I will give 
<i>her</i> the twopence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This incident, trifling as it may seem to some, will not fail to gratify
others, whose hearts are anxiously desirous of improving the Gipsies.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1830, the author felt a strong desire to visit Farnham,
where were, at that time, thousands of poor people assembled to pick hops, 
among whom were many Gipsies.&nbsp; Stanley was sent a few days before to 
make known his intentions of preaching to them on the evening of a fixed 
day.&nbsp; While at Farnham, Stanley ate, drank, and slept in some of their
camps, by which he gained their confidence and affection.</p>
<p>During the author&rsquo;s stay he accompanied Stanley to various 
hop-plantations, where great numbers of the <!-- page 119--><a 
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>most wretched part of
the community are employed in the hopping season.&nbsp; Great numbers of 
tracts were distributed among them, while the author entered into many free
and familiar conversations with them.&nbsp; Many were found very much 
depraved; but none were more depraved among the Gipsies, than many of the 
other class; for they were blasphemers of God and his religion.&nbsp; One 
man, like many of old, stirred up the people to reject and despise the 
truth.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;No one would get any thing by praying to 
God;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;if people wanted bread on a Sunday, it would be 
better for them to steal a mess of potatoes, and wood to cook them with, 
than go to church.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the poor shuddered at his boldness,
and contempt of God&rsquo;s law.&nbsp; With much impudence he declared, 
&ldquo;that he knew a man who put his dough into the oven on a Sunday 
without heating it, and then went to church to pray that God would bake it 
for him; but that the fool was disappointed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The minister said
to him&mdash;&ldquo;You know that you have told a wilful lie.&nbsp; You 
never knew such a man.&nbsp; There is not one of these little children will
believe you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He appeared confounded at this unexpected 
rebuke.&nbsp; May this sinner repent and be saved!</p>
<p>Among the hop-pickers of Farnham were many Gipsies the visitors had long
known; and their smiling faces spoke the gladness of their hearts and the 
warmth of their gratitude, when they were noticed by their friends 
affectionately and kindly; nor had they forgotten <!-- page 120--><a 
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>the favours that had 
been shewn them at Southampton.</p>
<p>Those of the Gipsies who were not acquainted with the object the author 
had in view, in paying them a visit, were much alarmed when enquiries were 
made for the Gipsies in the hop-grounds; supposing they were pursued by the
magistrates.&nbsp; One youth told Stanley, that he knew not whether to run,
or stay where he was; but recollecting to have been <i>in no spray 
lately</i>, he resolved on staying.&nbsp; When Stanley spoke to him in his 
own language, and introduced the minister, all his fears vanished.&nbsp; 
The Gipsies were astonished that any one should travel forty miles to see 
them.</p>
<p>Their public meeting was after the labours of the day, near one of the 
hop-grounds, about half an hour after sun-set.&nbsp; A few small candles 
gave light to a small tenement, used as a lodging place for the 
hop-gatherers, where the congregation was accommodated.&nbsp; A few of the 
inhabitants of Farnham, and some of the female Gipsies, who were much 
delighted to mingle with them in the worship of God, were put inside, and 
the men, with such women and children as could not get in, stood outside, 
the place being very much too small for so great a number of people.&nbsp; 
The preacher stood on the threshold of the door and addressed the people, 
of whom those without could only be seen now and then, as an adjacent wood 
fire cast at intervals upon them an intermitting light.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr 
Johnson <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
121</span>kindly attended, and assisted in the devotional part of the 
service; and some of his congregation obligingly assisted in the 
singing.</p>
<p>On this occasion the Gospel of Christ was addressed to many who had 
never before heard an exposition of the blessed word of God.&nbsp; The 
sermon was from Psalm lxxxvi. 5.&nbsp; After service the Gipsies were 
exhorted to seek for opportunities of attending the house of God; to beg of
some minister a bible for every tent; and to ask every one who may come 
near them to read certain of its pages to them.</p>
<p>During the address, many of <i>their crimes</i> were enlarged upon, and 
their dread of, and liability to punishment for them in this world; and 
they were urged to call on the God of all compassion and mercy, for help 
and for forgiveness, by that all-powerful motive, that he will never be 
inattentive to the prayers of the most helpless, wretched, and guilty 
sinner, when presented to God by faith in our only mediator, Jesus 
Christ.</p>
<p>Stanley, who, after the service, accompanied the Gipsies to their tents,
found that the sermon afforded conversation for the whole evening.&nbsp; 
One of them said, &ldquo;The minister has told us every thing, as though he
had lived with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another observed, &ldquo;If it be all true 
what the gentleman has said, not a Gipsy can be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; A third
exhorted his children &ldquo;never to say bad words again.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
little creature replied&mdash;&ldquo;Then I hope my <i>grandfer</i> 
(grandfather) will never swear any more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of them talked 
of the evils <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>of fortune-telling, and some resolved on going to Southampton, to
see the reformed Gipsies.</p>
<p>During the stay of the minister in that neighbourhood, eighty of them 
were visited, among whom was a dying woman, who very gladly received 
instruction, and heard prayer.&nbsp; A minister, in the neighbourhood, had 
been asked to visit her, but had neglected to do so.</p>
<p>The author must not forget to acknowledge the kindness of the farmers 
who assisted him in the distribution of tracts, &amp;c. &amp;c., and who 
solicited that some might be left them for that purpose.</p>
<p>This visit afforded an opportunity to contradict many false reports of 
the treatment with which the Gipsy children had met in the Infants&rsquo; 
Schools at Southampton.&nbsp; It was said that they were all confined, and 
would at a future period be transported.&nbsp; This shews how easily people
who deceive others, are imposed on themselves.</p>
<p>The following letter was addressed to the author by a Gipsy woman when 
she was in great trouble of mind.&nbsp; It is presented to the reader just 
as it was received, and may be found interesting to the friends of their 
cause.</p>

<p>The following letter, too, refers to the writer of the above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Bristol</i>, <i>August</i>, 1830.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I know that you are deeply interested in every circumstance 
relating to the Gipsies, I trouble you <!-- page 124--><a 
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>with the following 
anecdote.&nbsp; In the month of January last, when walking in the city of 
Bristol, I met a Gipsy woman, who accosted me with the usual salutation of 
her race, &ldquo;Shall I tell you your fortune?&rdquo;&nbsp; I enquired her
name, and then said, &ldquo;You well know that you are not able to tell me 
my fortune; and I am sorry to see you carrying on such 
deception.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then endeavoured to speak to her about the 
importance of considering her eternal welfare, and of seeking the salvation
which is in Christ Jesus; at the same time pointing out the certain 
condemnation she was bringing upon herself, by willingly following the 
<i>multitude to do evil</i>, even carrying <i>a lie in her right 
hand</i>.&nbsp; She urged that her trade (which she acknowledged to be 
built on deceit and falsehood) was her only support; and that she must 
starve if she followed my advice.&nbsp; I reminded her that she would be 
like Dives, if she gained the whole world and lost her own soul; but that 
were she indeed to honour God, by giving up her wicked trade, because she 
knew that it was displeasing to him, he would never suffer her to want any 
good thing.&nbsp; After much more conversation, she assured me that she 
would never tell fortunes again, and would discontinue her evil habits of 
life.&nbsp; I told her that I could not allow her to make to me any promise
of the kind; for she did not know her wickedness, nor the power which could
alone prevent her from committing sin.&nbsp; I again besought her to avail 
herself of the means of instruction within her power.</p>
<p>Before leaving the city, I commended her to the <!-- page 125--><a 
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>care of some pious 
friends, who were interested in my account of her, and who kindly promised 
not to lose sight of her.&nbsp; Since that time I have received very 
pleasing accounts from them respecting her.&nbsp; They have purchased 
materials in order that she may be able to support herself by 
basket-making, which she has begun; and I trust she has relinquished her 
former trade.&nbsp; She is making progress in reading, and constantly 
attends the preaching of the Gospel.&nbsp; I hope also that she is really 
in earnest for the welfare of her soul.&nbsp; I earnestly wish that every 
one would take an interest in the same; and I should be much rejoiced if 
the circumstance which I have just mentioned, should be the means of 
encouraging any one to notice those Gipsies with whom they may occasionally
meet, and to exert themselves in saving them from their present degraded 
condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, my dear Sir,<br />
&nbsp;  &ldquo;Yours respectfully,<br />

<p><i>Wm. Stanley&rsquo;s Letter to the Author</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hon. Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish me to give you some account of the Gipsies, I gladly 
comply with your request.&nbsp; I am a poor individual of that wandering 
race, called Gipsies; yet, by the mercies of God, I was <i>rescued</i> from
that wandering life.&nbsp; In my <i>youthful days</i> I entered into the 
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
126</span>Wiltshire militia, when it pleased God to bring me under the 
preaching of the Gospel at Exeter; and it was the means of awakening my 
conscience.&nbsp; <i>From that time I have often been led to bepity the sad
state of the people whereof I made a part</i>.&nbsp; I have given them the 
best instruction that lay in my power, and by reading the Scriptures to 
them; but with very little visible effect for many years.&nbsp; Neither did
I think, till lately, that there were any of them in the world, that cared 
for their souls, till the year 1827; when I was quite <i>overcome with love
to God</i>, <i>to find that the Lord had put it into the hearts of his dear
people at Southampton</i>, <i>to pity them in their forlorn condition</i>; 
and now wonder not if I am at a loss for words to speak the feeling of my 
heart; for, since that time I have seen <i>seventeen or eighteen</i>; 
<i>nay</i>, <i>from twenty to thirty</i>; <i>nay</i>, <i>from forty to 
fifty attend divine worship</i>; and <i>add</i> to this the many happy 
hours I have spent with them in their tents near Southampton, in reading 
and praying with them; and some of them that six months ago would not stay 
in their camp on my approach to them, but would go away swearing, will now 
receive me gladly, and produce a Bible or a Testament, which <i>had</i> 
been given to them, and desire me to read it to them, saying, this book was
given to me by our dear friends in Southampton.&nbsp; But, <i>dreadful to 
relate</i>, I find some children, <i>from three years old to fifteen</i>, 
who never <i>said a prayer to their God</i>; who never heard any one pray, 
and who <i>was</i> never in a church or chapel, nor have heard of the name 
of Christ, but in blaspheming; and <!-- page 127--><a 
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>these are the 
inhabitants of England!&nbsp; Oh, England! England! they are living and 
dying without God: no wonder if they draw down the divine vengeance of 
Heaven on the land!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of these poor <i>ignorant mortals</i> do not know that they 
are doing wrong by fortune-telling; and being informed that it is 
displeasing to God, and ruinous to their own souls, they will say, it is 
<i>of no service for me to give attendance to religion</i>, for I am forced
to ruin my soul for every morsel of bread I eat; but if God spares my life 
I will leave it off as soon as I can; while others who are both ignorant 
and hardened in their crimes, have told me it was the gift of God to them, 
by which they were to gain their living.&nbsp; Surely they call <i>darkness
light</i>!&nbsp; Many of my people who join in talk with me, declare, that 
if the Bible which I read to them be true, there cannot be many 
saved.&nbsp; But they say that a reformation is needful, and this is 
promised by them; and I am in great hopes that the time is at hand.&nbsp; 
Oh, Lord! work for thine own glory, and stir up the minds of thy people in 
all parts of the land, that they may help forward this good work amongst 
these poor wanderers!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their ignorance and their crimes seem to have increased of late 
years.&nbsp; When I was a boy, I well recollect their parting expressions, 
which <i>was</i> so common amongst them&mdash;<i>Artmee Devillesty</i>, 
which is&mdash;<i>God bless you</i>.&nbsp; But now it is <i>truly 
awful</i>; it is <i>darkness itself</i>, <i>for they now ask God to send 
them good luck</i> in their crimes.&nbsp; I <i>myself</i> thought for many 
years, <i>till </i><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 128</span><i>I heard the Gospel</i>, <i>that God was 
like some great gentleman</i>, <i>living at a great distance from us</i>; 
but I had not a thought that he was every where present to notice the 
conduct of his creatures, or to hear prayer.&nbsp; The ignorance of <i>my 
people</i> is a loud call to Christians to assist; and, blessed be God, 
they find that assistance in Southampton.&nbsp; The Bible has often been 
taken away from Southampton in the Gipsies&rsquo; pack, and I have seen it 
when they have returned, preserved with a great deal of care, and produced 
for me to read, with great delight on their part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely this blessed book will not be idle, but will do 
<i>wonders</i> amongst them, <i>through God&rsquo;s grace</i>.&nbsp; I see 
the effects already; do you say, how?&nbsp; I answer, <i>Was it ever 
known</i>, <i>till now</i>, that Gipsies assembled on the sabbath day on 
the common and in the lanes for divine worship?&nbsp; Did you ever see them
come to town on a sabbath day in such great numbers as they now do, when 
encamping near Southampton?&nbsp; Some of the most ignorant of them are now
learning to read the Scriptures.&nbsp; This is the beginning of good 
days.&nbsp; Oh! the good this will do to <i>my people at large</i>!&nbsp; 
Nothing of importance took place in their camp all last summer, <i>and I 
almost fainted under the discouragement</i>; but of late <i>it shows 
another face</i>; and I make no doubt but it will spread, and I shall soon 
see greater things than these.</p>
<p>I am, hon. Sir,<br />
Your most obliged and humble Servant,<br />

<p>This poor man, when a soldier, and in the habit of attending divine 
service, as a part of his duty, often heard his comrades speak of the text,
on their return to the barracks.&nbsp; He one day made up his mind to bring
home the text also, the next time he went to church.&nbsp; He heard with 
attention, and when he returned to the barracks, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got the text now.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it, Stanley?&rdquo; he was 
asked by a comrade, when he answered, &ldquo;The 19th day of the month, and
the 95th Psalm.&rdquo;&nbsp; When relating this to the author, he added, 
&ldquo;I had the mortification to be laughed at by all my comrades who 
witnessed my ignorance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do not many professing Christians come
away from the house of God as ignorant as this poor Gipsy?&nbsp; Or if they
have been taught to know and remember the text, it is all they attend 
to.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s mind did not long remain in this dark 
state.&nbsp; After the above event he learned to read, and one day, taking 
up a Testament from the barracks&rsquo; table, he read a portion of it, 
(for so he expressed himself)&nbsp; <i>The sublimity of the language struck
his mind with astonishment</i>, and he said, <i>I will buy that book if I 
can</i>.&nbsp; His comrade asked him three halfpence for it; and he was 
glad of his purchase; although the Testament was very much torn.&nbsp; The 
Holy Scriptures were scarce in those days, a copy of which could seldom be 
bought by the poor; <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>nor, indeed, would the word of life have been 
useful to them, as not one in a hundred could read.</p>
<p>Soon after this, he was invited to attend a Wesleyan chapel in Exeter, 
where a funeral sermon was to be preached by the Rev. Wm. Aver.&nbsp; The 
text was, <i>Let me die the death of the righteous</i>, <i>and let my last 
end be like his</i>.&nbsp; While the minister was describing the happiness 
of the righteous, divine light shone upon his soul, he felt that <i>he</i> 
was not that character, and that there was no prospect of his dying 
happily, unless he possessed it.&nbsp; This sermon was the means of his 
conversion.</p>

131</span>CHAP. XIV.&nbsp; Interesting particulars of the Gipsies, related 
by a Clergyman.</h2>
<p>The following account is selected from a tract published in York, in 
1822, detailing several interesting visits that a Yorkshire clergyman made 
to some of the camps of that wandering and neglected people.&nbsp; Were the
author of the little book known, application would have been made to him, 
for permission to reprint these extracts.&nbsp; But it is hoped he will 
excuse the liberty taken, as the design is to <i>induce other clergymen and
ministers to go and do likewise</i>.&nbsp; This clergyman, having fallen in
with a gang of Gipsies on the road, who were travelling to their place of 
encampment, addressed a young female among them, and found her not ignorant
of religion.&nbsp; &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said the clergyman, &ldquo;did you 
obtain the knowledge of religion?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered 
she, &ldquo;in the depth of winter, the men folks only travel; the women 
and children belonging to my family and party, always live in the 
town.&nbsp; In those seasons I have gone with some of our relatives, who 
live there, and are religious people, to the worship of God: in that way I 
have learned these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a practical comment on the text which says, <i>The 
entrance of the word giveth light</i>; <i>it giveth </i><!-- page 132--><a 
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span><i>understanding to 
the simple</i>.&nbsp; After giving her some suitable advice, and with it 
his benediction, he left her; but not without hopeful expectations that the
seeds of grace were sown in her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He next overtook the grandmother and several of her 
grandchildren.&nbsp; She was pleased at his noticing her, and answered his 
enquiries with modesty and propriety.&nbsp; She corroborated what her 
daughter had said, and in her answers discovered not only an acquaintance 
with the general truths of the Gospel, but a feeling sense of their 
importance.&nbsp; She said, &lsquo;I love to go to church, and do go 
<i>now</i>, sir, when I can; but do not always meet with the right 
doctrines: my prayers I offer up night and morning, under the hedge.&nbsp; 
I hope God Almighty hears my prayers.&rsquo;&nbsp; The clergyman observed, 
that sincere prayer was acceptable to God any where, equally under the 
hedge, as in the parlour, or in the church.&nbsp; When arrived at their 
camp, he promised them a Bible, as they had none, and directed some of the 
party to call at the friend&rsquo;s house in the neighbourhood where he was
staying.&nbsp; Soon after his return thither, a knock was heard at the 
door, when it was announced, &lsquo;Two Gipsies, sir, are come for a 
Bible.&rsquo;&nbsp; On going out, he found in the hall the young man who 
could read, and a younger brother, a fine boy of about fourteen years of 
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gentleman who wrote the account, adds as 
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their countenances were very animated and expressive; there 
seemed to be a ray of heavenly brightness resting upon them; and while I 
gave them a <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
133</span>charge how to read the sacred gift, they were much affected: the 
boy, in particular, listened with eager attention, fixing his eyes first on
me, then on the Bible.&nbsp; After I had inscribed their names in the 
title-page, they departed with my blessing; and what is better&mdash;with 
the blessing of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another part of the year, this clergyman returned to the same spot 
where he had before been so delightfully engaged in attempting to benefit 
the poor Gipsies.&nbsp; He found out another camp, and thus writes of 
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my approach to the camp (where was a group of nearly naked 
children,) the Gipsy girls rose up, and, in a modest and respectful manner,
answered my questions; while the little swarthy group of children gathered 
around me.&nbsp; To one of these girls I said, &lsquo;How is it that you 
bear such a wandering and exposed life?&rsquo;&nbsp; In reply, she said, 
&lsquo;Sir, it is <i>use</i>; <i>use</i> is second nature.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But have you any religion?&nbsp; Do you think about God, about 
judgment, and eternity?&nbsp; Do you know how to pray?&rsquo;&nbsp; She 
answered, &lsquo;I say my prayers, sir, night and morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; I 
then said, &lsquo;can any of your people read?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, 
sir,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;one of our men that is not here, can read 
very well.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you a Bible among you?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;No, sir; we should be thankful for one, sir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On leaving the camp, the clergyman promised to call on them again, when 
the other part of the family should be returned from the town, where they 
were gone to vend their wares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my return to the encampment,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I <!-- 
page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>was met
by two men who came out to greet me.&nbsp; I asked them kindly of their 
names.&nbsp; They informed me it was Bosvill.&nbsp; The women and children 
were now collected around me.&nbsp; I inquired who among them could 
read.&nbsp; Captain Bosvill, for so I called him, answered me, &lsquo;My 
wife, sir, can read any thing in English.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was glad to hear 
this, and asked them if they had any books.&nbsp; Bosvill went to a package
and brought forth his stock, fragments of an old Testament, and an old 
spelling-book.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what use do you make of your spelling 
book?&rsquo; asked I.&nbsp; &lsquo;My wife,&rsquo; replied Bosvill, 
&lsquo;when she has time, teaches the children their letters.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
I now shewed them the Bible I had in my pocket, saying, that as it was so 
holy and blessed a book, it ought not to be given in an indifferent and 
common manner; and asked, if I were to ride over in the evening to give it 
them, and to explain to them its use, whether they would be all together to
hear me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, yes;&rsquo; was the reply, from many 
voices.&nbsp; I appointed seven o&rsquo;clock for the purpose.&nbsp; I then
distributed amongst them some tracts, containing passages for every day in 
the week, and also the tract of Short Sermons; for which they were very 
thankful.&nbsp; I told them that I intended to give them a Bible in the 
evening, a book which few of them had ever seen, and which fewer 
understood.&nbsp; I was pleased with the modesty of their deportment, and 
with their eagerness for instruction.&nbsp; Surely they are a people whose 
hearts the Lord has prepared for the reception of his word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the hour appointed, I put the Bible in my <!-- page 135--><a 
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>pocket, and rode 
again to the camp.&nbsp; The evening was particularly fine: the sun, hidden
behind some thick fleecy clouds, had thrown around a mild and pleasing 
tint; the birds were every where singing their evening song; the ploughman 
was &lsquo;whistling o&rsquo;er the lea;&rsquo; and nature, after the 
labours of the day, was preparing for her wonted rest.&nbsp; It was a fit 
time for meditation, prayer, and praise.&nbsp; Such an evening, perhaps, as
that which led the patriarch of old to meditation, when he lifted up his 
eyes and saw the returning servants of his father bringing home his future 
wife.&nbsp; As I drew near to the camp, I began to revolve in my mind the 
best way of making them acquainted with the importance of the most 
essential doctrines contained in the holy book I was about to give 
them.&nbsp; On my arrival, I found that I had been long expected.&nbsp; The
men, however, were not there; they were gone to water a horse, which they 
had lent all the day to a farmer; but a tawny girl ran with great speed, 
barefooted, and brought them to the camp.&nbsp; I now dismounted, and gave 
my horse, with my stick, to the care of one of the men.&nbsp; The family 
circle was formed into an irregular circle round some pale embers, some of 
them sitting cross-legged on the grass, and others standing.&nbsp; I placed
myself so as to have the women and children chiefly before me.&nbsp; The 
woman who could read, was seated opposite me: the men, the tents, and the 
package to the right; while the horses and asses belonging to the tribe, 
were quietly grazing at a short distance in the lane.&nbsp; All was solemn 
stillness; all was attentive expectation.&nbsp; <!-- page 136--><a 
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>As I took from my 
pocket the Bible, the eyes of the whole company were instantly fixed upon 
it.&nbsp; This book, said I, which I bring you, is the book of God; it is 
sent from heaven to make poor miserable and dying man happy.&nbsp; I then 
spoke a short time on God; on creation; how God created man upright; how he
was once happy in paradise; the way in which he sinned, and broke the law 
of his Maker, and became guilty, polluted, and exposed to death and hell; 
that to save men from this dreadful state, God devised a plan of mercy; 
that he sent his Son, and the Scriptures of truth, which shew unto us the 
way of salvation.&nbsp; This was something of the outline of my lecture; 
but I added the responsibility of men to read the book, and to seek to 
understand it.&nbsp; I solemnly charged them, by the sacred book itself, 
and by the account which they, at the day of judgment, must give to God for
it, to make the most sacred and constant use of it, by reading it together 
daily in their camp.&nbsp; In the course of my discourse, I stopped, and 
said,&mdash;&lsquo;Now do you understand what I say?&rsquo;&nbsp; Captain 
Bosvill&rsquo;s wife replied, &lsquo;We understand you, sir; but we have 
not the same words which you have.&rsquo;&nbsp; In conclusion, I spoke of 
the coming judgment, when they and all men must stand and be judged at the 
righteous bar of God.&nbsp; The Bible was then delivered to the care of the
captain of the gang, and of his wife, the woman who could read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I said, let us all kneel down on the grass, and pray for 
God&rsquo;s blessing with this holy book.&nbsp; Instantly a female brought 
from her tent a small piece of <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>carpet, and spread it before me on the grass, 
for me to kneel upon; and then all kneeling down, I prayed that the minds 
of these miserable outcasts of society might be enlightened, to discover 
the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the blessedness and efficiency of the 
Saviour; that the sacred book given them through the influence of the Holy 
Ghost, might lead them into the way of righteousness, and finally guide 
them to everlasting life.&nbsp; When we rose from our knees, gratitude was 
seen in every countenance, and expressed by every tongue.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;<i>God bless you</i>, <i>sir</i>; <i>thank you</i>, 
<i>sir</i>;&rsquo; echoed throughout the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next evening this clergyman went again to the camp, when one of the 
Gipsies came to meet him, and informed him of the arrival of some of their 
relatives.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shook hands with them,&rdquo; says the clergyman,
&ldquo;and asked of their welfare.&nbsp; Never was a king received with a 
more hearty welcome, or with greater attention and respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was expected, the utmost order, cleanliness, and quiet, 
prevailed throughout the camp; and all were dressed in their best clothes 
to receive me.&nbsp; The arrangement of my congregation was much the same 
as the preceding evening.&nbsp; I spoke to them of the blessed Jesus; his 
birth, his ministry, his death, passion, and grace; and his glory at his 
second coming <i>in the clouds of heaven</i>, <i>to judge the world in 
righteousness</i>.&nbsp; I spoke also of death, and of the immortality of 
the soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not proceeded far in my lecture, before <!-- page 138--><a 
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>several farmers and 
passengers, some on horse back, and others on foot, joined my 
congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before concluding my address, I said, &lsquo;It may seem singular
to some of you that a stranger should interest himself on your behalf in 
the way I have done; and it might be expected that I should give some 
reasons for doing as I have.&nbsp; My chief reason is a sense of 
duty.&nbsp; Gipsies have long been neglected, and left to perish in their 
sins; but Gipsies have souls equally precious as others, and of equal price
in the sight of God.&nbsp; Who, I asked, cares for the souls of Gipsies? 
who uses means for their instruction in righteousness?&nbsp; Yet must it be
equally our duty to care for them, and to endeavour their conversion and 
happiness, as to plan societies, obtain subscriptions, and send out 
missionaries to the heathen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, moreover, that, &lsquo;supposing, when I first saw your 
camp, I had rode by you on the other side, and taken no notice of you, nor 
felt an interest in your welfare; and after that, had met you at the bar of
judgment; what would have been the language with which you might have 
addressed me at that awful period?&nbsp; Might you not have charged the 
misery of your eternal condemnation upon me, and said, The curse we are 
doomed to bear, thoughtless man, might, perchance, have been prevented by 
you?&nbsp; You saw us when riding by our camp lying in ignorance, and 
unbelief: you might have rode up to us, and imparted instruction to our 
perishing souls; because to you were committed the oracles of God, and you 
knew the way <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>to heaven.&nbsp; But, no, <i>cruel man</i>, our state excited in 
you no compassion, or desire for our salvation.&nbsp; In your conduct there
was no imitation of your Lord and Master.&nbsp; Go, cruel man, and if 
heaven you enter, let your felicity be embittered by the recollection of 
neglect to the Gipsy wanderers, whom Providence had placed in your way, 
that you might direct them to God, but which you neglected.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
conclusion, I again referred to the holy Bible, which I had given them; and
again repeated the way to use it.&nbsp; After which I said, Now we will 
conclude with prayer, as we did last evening.&nbsp; Immediately the same 
female who before brought the carpet, again spread it, with great civility,
for me to kneel upon; and again I offered up a solemn prayer for the 
salvation of these lost and perishing mortals.&nbsp; The greatest 
seriousness and awe rested upon the assembly.&nbsp; Surely the prayer was 
registered in heaven, and shall, in time not far distant, be 
answered.&mdash;Come, and take these heathens for thine inheritance, and 
the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.&mdash;When I proposed 
to take leave of my swarthy flock, it was not without feelings of 
attachment on both sides.&nbsp; I had observed several of them much 
affected under my discourse, and now they manifested it more openly.&nbsp; 
As I shook hands with them, I said, &lsquo;You see, I did not come among 
you to give you money.&nbsp; I considered religious instruction of the most
value; therefore I have endeavoured to impart it.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; replied several, &lsquo;we did not want your money; your
instruction is better to us than money; and we thank you for 
coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>The camp now resounded with voices, saying, 
&lsquo;Thank you, sir; God bless you, sir;&rsquo; and every countenance 
seemed to glow with gratitude.&nbsp; The young branches of the family 
seemed to think a great honour and blessing had been conferred upon 
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I mounted my pony to come away, I observed one of the females,
a fine young woman about twenty-five years of age, the same that brought 
the carpet from the package, and spread on the grass for me to kneel upon, 
to retire from the rest.&nbsp; She walked slowly near to the hedge, and 
appeared evidently much distressed.&nbsp; Her expressive eyes were lifted 
up to heaven, while the big tears rolling down her cheeks, were wiped away 
with her long black tresses.&nbsp; I thought&mdash;Here, surely, are some 
of the first fruits!&mdash;Thus did the woman, who was a sinner, weep, and 
with her hair wipe away the tears from the feet of her Saviour.&nbsp; May 
those tears be as acceptable to God: may the same Redeemer bid her go in 
peace!&nbsp; Her conduct attracted the notice of her family, and she was 
asked the reason of her sorrow.&nbsp; At first she could scarcely speak; 
but at length exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I am a sinner!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then 
lifting up her eyes to heaven, she wept aloud, and again wiped away the 
falling tears with her hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;But did you not know that before?
we are all sinners.&nbsp; What have you done to cause you so much 
distress?&rsquo;&nbsp; She made no reply, but shook her head and 
wept.&rdquo;</p>

Anecdote of his late beloved <span class="smcap">majesty</span>, <span 
class="smcap">george the third</span>.</h2>
<p>The following account is extracted from the Home Missionary Magazine for
June, 1823.</p>
<p><i>March</i>, 1823.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the following facts should afford any encouragement to the 
benevolent intentions of the Home Missionary Society, which has, for one of
its objects, the improvement of the state of the <i>poor Gipsies</i>, my 
end in relating them will be amply answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday evening, in the month of October, the narrator 
followed several Gipsy families.&nbsp; Being arrived at the place of their 
encampment, his first object was to gain their confidence.&nbsp; This was 
accomplished; after which, to amuse their unexpected visitant, they shewed 
forth their night diversions in music and dancing; likewise the means by 
which they obtained their livelihood, such as tinkering, fortune-telling, 
and conjuring.&nbsp; That the narrator might be satisfied whether he had 
obtained their confidence or not, he represented his dangerous situation, 
in the midst of which, they all with one voice cried, &lsquo;Sir, <!-- page
143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>we would 
kiss your feet, rather than hurt you!&rsquo;&nbsp; After manifesting a 
confidence in return, the master of this formidable gang, about forty in 
number, was challenged by the narrator for a conjuring match.&nbsp; The 
challenge was instantly accepted.&nbsp; The Gipsies placed themselves in 
the circular form, and both being in the middle, commenced with their 
conjuring powers to the best advantage.&nbsp; At last the narrator proposed
the making of something out of nothing.&nbsp; This proposal was 
accepted.&nbsp; A stone which never existed, was to be created, and appear 
in a certain form in the middle of a circle made on the turf.&nbsp; The 
master of the gang commenced, and after much stamping with his foot, and 
the narrator warmly exhorting him to cry aloud; like the roaring of a lion,
he endeavoured to call forth nonentity into existence.&nbsp; Asking him if 
he could do it? he answered, &lsquo;I am not strong enough.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
They were all asked the same question, which received the same 
answer.&nbsp; The narrator commenced.&nbsp; Every eye was fixed upon him, 
eager to behold this unheard-of exploit; but (and not to be wondered at,) 
he failed!&mdash;telling them, he possessed no more power to <i>create</i> 
than themselves.&nbsp; Perceiving the thought of insufficiency pervading 
their minds, he thus spoke:&mdash;&ldquo;Now, if you have not power to 
create a poor little stone, and if I have not power either; what must that 
power be, which made the whole world out of nothing?&mdash;men, women, and 
children! that power I call God Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night&rsquo;s diversion having received a change, <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the golden moment was
eagerly seized to impress on their minds the infinite power, holiness, and 
justice of their Creator.&nbsp; This being done, the origin of sin, and the
immortality of the soul, were, in the second place, impressed on their 
minds.&nbsp; Then followed the awful effects of sin, and the soul&rsquo;s 
eternal punishment in hell, because of offending this great God, whose 
holiness could not look on sin, and whose justice would punish it.&nbsp; 
Representing the soul&rsquo;s eternal punishment by the wrath of an 
incensed God, never did the preacher before witness such an effect; the 
poor Gipsies, with tremulous voice, crying, &lsquo;<i>Did you ever hear the
like</i>! <i> What ever shall we do</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; These expressions 
gave new energies to the preacher, and still brighter hopes of a good 
effect.&nbsp; Going on with the awful representation, and in the act of 
turning, as if to leave them, he bade them the long farewell.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Never, never more to meet till we meet in hell!&nbsp; Oh! what a 
dreadful thing it is, my fellow-sinners, that we have to part in this world
with the thought of meeting in an eternal world of pains, never to see God!
never to see heaven! never to see any thing to comfort our poor 
souls!&nbsp; Oh! we are lost, lost, poor souls, we are lost for 
ever!&mdash;farewell!&rsquo;&nbsp; In the act of leaving them, these poor 
creatures cried, &lsquo;Not yet, Sir, not yet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now was the 
glorious moment come, which the preacher eagerly anticipated of proclaiming
the glad tidings of salvation through a crucified Saviour.&nbsp; Asking how
long they would stand to hear the way of escape from the wrath to come, 
they instantly lifted up their voices, answering, <!-- page 145--><a 
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>&lsquo;All night, 
Sir, all night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the preacher, without much persuasion, 
exhibited a Saviour, in all his sufferings, merits, death, and glory.&nbsp;
They were sorry that such a good being should suffer so much; but the 
preacher took care to show the absolute necessity of his sufferings.&nbsp; 
Their manner bespoke an imperfect idea of a substitute.&nbsp; This was soon
made clear to their understandings by comparisons, when the master of the 
gang cried, &lsquo;I see it, I see it!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was asked what he 
saw?&nbsp; &lsquo;I see Jesus Christ getting between us and God, and 
satisfying our great God&rsquo;s justice by dying instead of 
us.&rsquo;&nbsp; This truly made the preacher&rsquo;s heart glad, seeing 
the great plan of salvation was so clearly understood by those who declared
(although in a land of light,) they never heard of Jesus Christ before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The preacher sang the hymn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How condescending, and how kind<br />
Was God&rsquo;s eternal Son, &amp;c,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then ended with prayer.&nbsp; They solicited him to return on the 
sabbath morning; he did so, and, as he hopes, under the influence of the 
Holy Spirit.&nbsp; The master gratefully accepted of a bible; for though 
the Gipsies could not read, a little boy was among them, who was not a 
Gipsy, that could read remarkably well, having been taught at a Sunday 
school at Hastings, in Sussex.&nbsp; They all joyfully anticipated the 
pleasure of going to the Rev. J. Carter&rsquo;s Chapel, of Braintree, in 
the afternoon, but met with a disappointment, arising <!-- page 146--><a 
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>from an unexpected 
decampment.&nbsp; About one month after, in the latter end of November, two
Gipsy women called on the narrator, earnestly entreating him to go and 
preach to them, which they called conversation.&nbsp; Asking the reason, 
why they entreated this favour? their answer was, &lsquo;We have heard much
about your conversation, sir, and we should like to hear it.&nbsp; Come, do
come, and we will be all ready to receive you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Asking who they
were that told them of the conversation just mentioned, they said, 
&lsquo;some of our people, Sir, that you were with about a month 
since.&nbsp; They told us a great deal about your conversation, and we 
should so much like to hear it.&nbsp; Oh! sir, do come to us poor 
creatures, for we have an invitation for you, if you would condescend to 
take it, to meet with the Gipsies on Christmas day.&rsquo;&nbsp; That 
night, the narrator walked a few miles to their camp, and in their smoky 
tent preached Jesus Christ the only way of salvation, to these poor, 
despised, neglected creatures.&nbsp; After being with them two hours and a 
half, he bade them farewell, and going behind a hedge, anxious to know what
effect the new unheard of doctrines would produce on their minds, he 
listened for a short time.&nbsp; In the midst of conversation with each 
other, one of them said, &lsquo;Well, I know this, if I could get a house 
near where that gentleman lives, and could live by my business, I would 
send all my children to that school there, and hear him as long as ever I 
could live.&rsquo;&nbsp; While they were conversing about Adam and Eve, and
the evil effects of sinning against God; one of the women said, 
&lsquo;However, <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>you see, all the punishment that us women get,
is sorrow and pains in child-bearing.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop, 
stop,&rsquo; says one of the men, &lsquo;that won&rsquo;t do, Ann, that 
won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; If sorrow and pains in child-bearing be all the 
punishment that women are to have, what punishment must those women have 
that do not bear children?&nbsp; You are quite wrong, Ann; you women are as
bad as <i>us</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; This led on to a further discovery, and the 
conversation among themselves was truly interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the children telling a lie, the mother touched it on the 
head, saying, &lsquo;What are you telling lies about?&nbsp; Have you 
forgotten what the gentleman said to night?&nbsp; You will go to hell, if 
you tell any more lies.&nbsp; Let me never hear you tell another, you bad 
lad, for God will not take you to heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These, and several remarks about Jesus Christ, afforded no small 
pleasure to the preacher, and he hopes that these facts will afford no 
small encouragement to the Home Missionary Society.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your very humble<br />
Servant,<br />
&ldquo;J. H. C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the author relates one of the most extraordinary anecdotes with 
which he is acquainted, one, of which a King and a dying Gipsy are the 
characters, he will relate another interesting account of a visit to a 
Gipsy camp, which will, it is hoped, prove that such visits are not in 
vain, when made in dependence on the Divine blessing.&nbsp; A Gipsy, in 
great distress of mind, and with weeping eyes, came to inform him of one of
<!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
148</span>their people, who was in great anguish of mind, and entreated him
to visit them at the camp, which was several miles distant.&nbsp; The 
request was gladly complied with.&nbsp; On arriving at the tent, he found a
woman sitting in a melancholy attitude on the ground; and distress and 
anguish were strongly marked in her countenance.&nbsp; She appeared quite 
indifferent to any thing that was said; and kept herself apparently engaged
with the sticks and brands around the fire near the mouth of the 
tent.&nbsp; The man also appeared very melancholy.&nbsp; We learned that 
the cause of their distress was jealousy on the part of the man, who was 
called her husband.&nbsp; The circumstance which gave rise to those unhappy
feelings had taken place several years before; yet the poor man has been so
unhappy, that he has often intended to destroy both himself and his wife; 
and not many days before this visit to the camp, he had threatened to 
execute his purpose.&nbsp; The author talked and prayed with him, and 
exhorted him to look to God for strength and grace.&nbsp; Their repeated 
conversations were made useful to him, and those miserable feelings were 
subdued, and he now lives happily with the woman he had before hated, even 
to an intention of murder.&nbsp; This is another evidence, although a 
distressing one, that a want of chastity is evil in their sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A king of England, of happy memory, who loved his people and his 
God, better than kings in general are wont to do, occasionally took the 
exercise of hunting.&nbsp; Being out one day for this purpose, <!-- page 
149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>the chase 
lay through the shrubs of the forest.&nbsp; The stag had been hard run; 
and, to escape the dogs, had crossed the river in a deep part.&nbsp; As the
dogs could not be brought to follow, it became necessary, in order to come 
up with it, to make a circuitous route along the banks of the river, 
through some thick and troublesome underwood.&nbsp; The roughness of the 
ground, the long grass and frequent thickets, gave opportunity for the 
sportsmen to separate from each other; each one endeavouring to make the 
best and speediest route he could.&nbsp; Before they had reached the end of
the forest, the king&rsquo;s horse manifested signs of fatigue and 
uneasiness; so much so, that his Majesty resolved upon yielding the 
pleasures of the chase to those of compassion for his horse.&nbsp; With 
this view, he turned down the first avenue in the forest, and determined on
riding gently to the oaks, there to wait for some of his attendants.&nbsp; 
His Majesty had only proceeded a few yards, when, instead of the cry of the
hounds, he fancied he heard the cry of human distress.&nbsp; As he rode 
forward, he heard it more distinctly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, my mother! my 
mother!&nbsp; God pity and bless my poor mother!&rsquo;&nbsp; The curiosity
and kindness of the king led him instantly to the spot.&nbsp; It was a 
little green plot on one side of the forest, where was spread on the grass,
under a branching oak, a little pallet, half covered with a kind of tent; 
and a basket or two, with some packs, lay on the ground at a few paces 
distant from the tent.&nbsp; Near to the root of the tree he observed a 
little swarthy girl, about eight years of age, on her knees, praying, <!-- 
page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>while 
her little black eyes ran down with tears.&nbsp; Distress of any kind was 
always relieved by his Majesty, for he had a heart which melted at 
&lsquo;human woe;&rsquo; nor was it unaffected on this occasion.&nbsp; And 
now he inquired, &lsquo;What, my child, is the cause of your weeping?&nbsp;
For what do you pray?&rsquo;&nbsp; The little creature at first started, 
then rose from her knees, and pointing to the tent, said, &lsquo;Oh, sir! 
my dying mother!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What?&rsquo; said his Majesty, 
dismounting, and fastening his horse up to the branches of the oak, 
&lsquo;what, my child? tell me all about it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The little 
creature now led the King to the tent:&mdash;there lay, partly covered, a 
middle-aged female Gipsy, in the last stages of a decline, and in the last 
moments of life.&nbsp; She turned her dying eyes expressively to the royal 
visitor, then looked up to heaven; but not a word did she utter; the organs
of speech had ceased their office; <i>the silver cord was loosed</i>, 
<i>and the wheel broken at the cistern</i>.&nbsp; The little girl then wept
aloud, and, stooping down, wiped the dying sweat from her mother&rsquo;s 
face.&nbsp; The King, much affected, asked the child her name, and of her 
family; and how long her mother had been ill.&nbsp; Just at that moment 
another Gipsy girl, much older, came, out of breath, to the spot.&nbsp; She
had been at the town of W---, and had brought some medicine for her dying 
mother.&nbsp; Observing a stranger, she modestly courtsied, and, hastening 
to her mother, knelt down by her side, kissed her pallid lips, and burst 
into tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;What, my dear child,&rsquo; said his Majesty, 
&lsquo;can be done for you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; she 
replied, &lsquo;my dying mother <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span

pray with her, before she died.&nbsp; I ran all the way before it was light
this morning to W---, and asked for a minister, <i>but no one could I get 
to come with me to pray with my dear mother</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; The dying 
woman seemed sensible of what her daughter was saying, and her countenance 
was much agitated.&nbsp; The air was again rent with the cries of the 
distressed daughters.&nbsp; The King, full of kindness, instantly 
endeavoured to comfort them: he said, &lsquo;I am a minister, and God has 
sent me to instruct and comfort your mother.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then sat down 
on a pack, by the side of the pallet, and taking the hand of the dying 
Gipsy, discoursed on the demerit of sin, and the nature of 
redemption.&nbsp; He then pointed her to Christ, the all sufficient 
Saviour.&nbsp; While the King was doing this, the poor creature seemed to 
gather consolation and hope: her eyes sparkled with brightness, and her 
countenance became animated.&nbsp; She looked up; she smiled; but it was 
the last smile; it was the glimmering of expiring nature.&nbsp; As the 
expression of peace, however, remained strong in her countenance, it was 
not till some little time had elapsed, that they perceived the struggling 
spirit had left mortality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at this moment that some of his Majesty&rsquo;s 
attendants, who had missed him at the chase, and who had been riding 
through the forest in search of him, rode up, and found the King comforting
the afflicted Gipsies.&nbsp; It was an affecting sight, and worthy of 
everlasting record in the annals of kings.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the afflicted girls, promised them his protection, and bade them look to 
heaven.&nbsp; He then wiped the tears from his eyes, and mounted his 
horse.&nbsp; His attendants, greatly affected, stood in silent 
admiration.&nbsp; Lord L--- was now going to speak, when his Majesty, 
turning to the Gipsies, and pointing to the breathless corpse, and to the 
weeping girls, said, with strong emotion, &lsquo;Who, my lord, who, 
thinkest thou, was neighbour unto these?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;In answer to your inquiries, I have to say, that within my 
knowledge, little or nothing has as yet been accomplished for the 
Gipsies.&nbsp; The Home Missionaries have frequently paid flying visits to 
their camps, and prayed, read, preached and distributed tracts.&nbsp; In 
all cases they have been treated with much respect, and their labour has 
been repaid with the most sincere marks of gratitude.&nbsp; But I never met
with very warm support in carrying on this object, but was often exposed to
some sarcastical insinuations or sardonic smiles from those who thought the
attempt to ameliorate the condition of the Gipsies, only Quixotic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think their wandering life is one very great impediment in the 
way of improving the Gipsy tribes, and yet they are so attached to it, 
that, when taken into families, as servants, they will not stay.&nbsp; Nor 
can any good be done to their children; for, like all wild people, the 
parents are attached to them to a fault; so that they cannot allow them to 
be absent from them even to enjoy the instruction of a school, suspecting 
that such a separation might end in their final disunion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were a distinct society formed to effect a reformation <!-- page 
154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>among the 
Gipsies, many of the nobility, and other classes of the higher orders, 
would no doubt subscribe.&nbsp; There is a feeling among them on the 
subject, and many times the formation of a society has been on the 
tapis.&nbsp; The Gipsies are singularly attached to the Establishment, and 
many of them are married at the parish churches; and it is a pity the 
episcopalian body have not taken them up.&nbsp; There is a prejudice 
against them which I think is unfounded; but I cannot enter into details in
a mere letter.&nbsp; People look on them as vagabonds, and <i>they</i> seem
shy in return; and hence they continue a kind of outcast body in a 
civilized country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any further steps are taken, and if I can in any way assist in
promoting your good object, you may command my services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, dear sir, respectfully yours,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">I. Cobbin</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best thanks are due to you for your compliance with my 
request; and, in return, I beg to assure you, that I consider your answer 
to my friend&rsquo;s objection, as quite satisfactory and efficient.&nbsp; 
I rejoice to hear that God has been pleased to bless the endeavours and 
earnest exertion of the Scripture-readers (to the Gipsies) with 
success.&nbsp; To behold sixteen, and afterwards twenty-one Gipsies 
voluntarily attending Divine <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>worship, must have conveyed feelings of 
heartfelt gratitude to the heart of every Christian, and at the same time 
encourage him to persevere in earnest prayer to the Father of mercies, to 
pour his holy Spirit into their souls, that they might become the true and 
faithful followers of the Redeemer.&nbsp; You say you would be glad to 
receive any intelligence respecting this interesting people; by which I am 
led to suppose that an account of an interview which I had with some of 
them, may not be unacceptable; an interview that was highly pleasing and 
satisfactory, as I found them less ignorant of spiritual concerns, and to 
possess better qualities, than I had imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having sent for two women, (the heads of the camps) I received 
them in a cottage in the town of ---, and after allowing them some 
refreshment, proceeded to put the different questions to them that are 
inserted in the Observer.&nbsp; They told me that their family, altogether,
consisted of eighteen persons, who travelled about the country in three 
camps; that the men found it difficult to obtain regular employment; that 
sometimes, during the winter, they made cabbage-nets, and mended culinary 
utensils; that in the summer, men and women were occasionally employed in 
making hay, &amp;c.&nbsp; These women appeared very destitute of necessary 
clothing, which they said they found great difficulty in obtaining.&nbsp; 
They appeared careful to speak the truth, alleging that it hurt their 
consciences to speak otherwise.&nbsp; On the question being put to them, 
whether they appropriated to themselves the property <!-- page 156--><a 
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>of those near whom 
they encamped? they candidly confessed that they sometimes took a little 
straw, hay, and sticks; but no fowls or any other live-stock.&nbsp; They 
shewed a very affectionate disposition and warm feelings towards their 
children.&nbsp; The eldest of them assured me, that if any in their camp 
became orphans, she considered herself more bound to provide for them than 
her own, as the former needed it the more, being destitute.&nbsp; She did 
not object to their gaining instruction, if it came in the way, and she 
wished to be read to herself, and appeared to take much pleasure in 
listening to my explanations of the important doctrines of religion.&nbsp; 
They said that none of their party could read, but that they were sometimes
visited by a relative who was a good scholar.&nbsp; She said, too, that she
always kept in her possession a <i>godly book</i>, for the purpose of 
asking, as opportunity offered, a traveller to read to them.&nbsp; She 
assured me, too, (which I rather doubted,) that they constantly attended 
Divine worship, when encamped near enough to churches; that they send for 
the nearest clergyman <i>to preach</i> to the dying, and that they never 
omit having their babes <i>full christened</i>, excepting in cases of 
sickness, when the child is only baptized: and should such child die, they 
obtain the services of a parochial clergyman to inter it.&nbsp; They said, 
thinking, no doubt, to please me, that they did not like the Ranters, but 
that they thought well of the <i>church folks</i>.&nbsp; I fear that, 
though they had a general knowledge of the Supreme Being, they were sadly 
ignorant of the most important point of Christianity, <!-- page 157--><a 
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>namely, the 
all-sufficient sacrifice that was made for the whole world.&nbsp; While I 
expatiated to them on the day of judgment and the final doom of man, 
displaying the extreme and exquisite happiness of the righteous part of the
human family, and the dreadful misery of the wicked, the younger of them, 
who appeared indisposed, was considerably agitated.&nbsp; They then said, 
that they were not in the habit of swearing, but occasionally did so, 
though they were aware it was very wicked.&nbsp; When travelling, they told
me that they avoid breaking the sabbath; and that they visit all places 
included in the district through which they wander, three times per year, 
from which plan they seldom deviate.&nbsp; I inquired if they would like to
settle in cottages, and gain their livelihood by industry.&nbsp; They 
replied, that <i>if house-rent</i>, <i>clothes</i>, <i>food</i>, <i>and all
other necessaries were found them</i>, they would; but that they would not 
settle on any other condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am desirous of obtaining your opinion respecting the plan I 
have lately formed to benefit this people; for, should you approve of it, 
it will be carried into immediate execution.&nbsp; I thought it would be 
very advantageous to offer an adequate remuneration to a pious person who 
would devote every half-day to reading and explaining the Scriptures to the
old, and teaching the young to read.&nbsp; I was aware that it would be 
difficult to obtain one, who, while he would teach the young to read, and 
explain the Scriptures to the aged, would be wise enough to give wholesome 
advice to every case of mental distress, and be gifted to guide the first 
steps of <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
158</span>those who are disposed to be good, in the way of Christian 
godliness.&nbsp; After much anxiety and many attempts, I at length 
succeeded in meeting with a person most disinterestedly pious; one who was 
willing to accede to any proposal to benefit his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; He
appears to attach little importance to himself, but to have much confidence
in God, in reference to his exertions.&nbsp; He is really desirous to 
promote the immortal interests of the poor people to whom his attention has
been directed, and is pious, zealous and intelligent.&nbsp; He, however, 
cannot devote himself to this work more than three days per week.&nbsp; He 
will visit all Gipsy camps for seven or eight miles round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some clear, forcible, simple, religious tracts, such as are 
likely to instruct and awaken, with the Scriptures, would, perhaps, be of 
service.&nbsp; I shall hold out rewards of clothes and books to those of 
whom I hear the best accounts, and shall endeavour to meet them, a few at a
time, in a cottage, at least once per year.&nbsp; Will you let me know 
whether you think I am doing right?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Extracts of a Letter from a man of plain</i>, <i>but pious 
character</i>, <i>addressed to the Southampton Committee</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is natural for me to suppose that you expect, by this period, 
to hear something of the success that has attended my labours on the common
among the people called Gipsies.&nbsp; I visit them three or four times 
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
159</span>a-week, besides going among them on sabbath days.&nbsp; I go from
tent to tent, and talk to them on religious subjects, read and explain the 
word of God to them, so far as I am able, and pray with them.&nbsp; At such
times they thankfully receive what I humbly communicate to them, and often,
with tears and gratitude, wonder that I should think of them in their poor 
degraded state.&nbsp; I hope some of them may be brought to the knowledge 
of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some other pleasing details, this humble person concludes his 
letter thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to the children, I meet with here and there 
<i>one</i> among them that can read, but it is very little.&nbsp; These 
children, however, are desirous, I may say very desirous to have some 
little books.&nbsp; To such I have given books, till I have none 
left.&nbsp; I could have given away, where desired, and with the prospect 
of knowing they might be useful, many more, had I possessed them.&nbsp; 
Upon the whole I think there is cause for much encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, gentlemen, your humble servant,<br />
&nbsp;  &ldquo;* * * * *&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A clergyman, a most valuable correspondent, observes, while addressing 
the Committee, through the author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In speaking to the Gipsies on the road side, and offering a 
tract, I have never but once met with impertinence.&nbsp; <!-- page 
160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>It is 
probable that the individual had been impertinently treated, first, by 
people called Christians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr More has well said, with respect to the Jews, &lsquo;If 
Christians had believed and acted like Christians, it would have been a 
miracle if the Jews had not been converted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This observation is equally applicable to the Gipsies of England;
for, if Christian denominations did their duty, they would cease to be 
Gipsies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
161</span>CHAP. XVII.&nbsp; Concluding Remarks.</h2>
<p>Had the author availed himself of all the facts relating to the 
addresses which have been given in different places by clergymen, home 
missionaries, and other ministers, and published all the letters of an 
interesting nature addressed to himself and the Southampton Committee, in 
reference to the Gipsies, together with the gratitude they have shown for 
such Christian attentions, it might have gratified many readers; but these 
pages would thereby have been increased to too great a number.</p>
<p>But, before concluding this little work, he desires to impress upon the 
reader, the necessity there is of engaging in the great work of the 
conversion of the poor Gipsies.</p>
<p>Why do not all ministers, and all good people unite in it?&nbsp; May we 
not conclude that they do not feel the value of their souls as they ought, 
if they do not perform all that is in their power for this end?&nbsp; Both 
ministers and their congregations are too lukewarm.&nbsp; We are 
discouraged by difficulties under the influence of unbelief, and we often 
say, How can these things be accomplished?&nbsp; Every Christian is called 
by his Saviour to attempt the instruction of his fellow-creatures; <!-- 
page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>and no 
common excuse, such as business, poverty, a want of time, acknowledged 
ignorance, and a want of talent, can justify us in neglecting the attempt 
to speak a word of advice, or reproof, or promise, to our 
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; This is the duty of every Christian, and if done in
faith, Almighty God will bless the effort.</p>
<p>To the magistrates the author would make a most ardent appeal on behalf 
of the despised members of the Gipsy family.&nbsp; Most respectfully and 
most earnestly does he entreat them to pity their destitute condition, when
brought before them as vagrants, and from which they have been so often 
made to suffer; for, sooner would the wild creatures of the forest be 
tamed, than those branches of the human family be brought, through 
coercion, to dwell in houses and follow trades, who were born under the 
hedges, and have, through life, made unfrequented solitudes their 
homes.&nbsp; Much better would it be for the magistrates to encourage the 
education of their children, with the view to improve and reform the rising
generation.&nbsp; The author hopes and prays that they may.&nbsp; 
<i>Blessed are the merciful</i>, <i>for they shall obtain mercy</i>.</p>
<p>If we all felt the importance and necessity of discharging our Christian
duties as the sailor and the soldier do in their different stations, no 
difficulties would deter us; but God expects every <i>Christian</i> to do 
his duty.&nbsp; A celebrated commander once called his officers together, 
and said, &ldquo;We must carry such a garrison.&rdquo;&nbsp; The officers 
said, &ldquo;It is impossible; the attempt would be vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
general replied, &ldquo;It can, and must be <!-- page 163--><a 
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>done, for I have the 
order in my pocket.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! ye ministers of Christ! you have the 
order lying on your table, and in your desks, at this moment; read it in 
the Bible:&mdash;<i>Go ye into the highways and hedges</i>, <i>and compel 
them to come in</i>, <i>that my house may be filled</i>.&nbsp; Luke xiv. 
23.&nbsp; The duty is ours: have we done it?&nbsp; Have we done it as 
opportunities have presented themselves?&nbsp; Have we done it as we 
ought?&nbsp; Yea, more; have we sought for opportunities to instruct 
souls?&nbsp; Our adorable Master did so.&nbsp; He came from heaven to 
earth, to seek and to save them who were lost.&nbsp; Private Christians! 
you also have your order from the high throne of heaven, in your houses, 
perhaps unnoticed; or, it may be, you have not rightly interpreted these 
orders to their full extent.&nbsp; Others may have acted the coward&rsquo;s
part, and thrown these orders aside.&nbsp; Would a soldier or a sailor thus
serve his king and country?&nbsp; If you saw your countrymen perishing on 
your shores by shipwreck, or likely to be destroyed by fire, would you not 
be anxious to assist both the virtuous and the wicked?&nbsp; Gipsies are 
perishing around you; hear their cries, ere they are plunged into eternity;
and attend to these orders from the King of Kings:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Thou shalt not avenge</i>, <i>nor bear any grudge against the 
children of thy people</i>; <i>but thou shalt love thy neighbour as 
thyself</i>.&nbsp; Leviticus, xix. 18.&nbsp; <i>The stranger that dwelleth 
with you shall be as one born amongst you</i>, <i>and thou shalt love him 
as thyself</i>; xxxiv. 5.&nbsp; <i>Beware of hardness of heart toward thy 
poor brother</i>.&nbsp; Deut. vii. 15, 9.&nbsp; <i>Be ye therefore </i><!--
page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
164</span><i>merciful</i>, <i>as your Father who is in heaven is 
merciful</i>.&nbsp; Luke vi. 36.&nbsp; <i>For he raiseth up the poor out of
the dust and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill</i>.&nbsp; Psalm cxiii. 
7.&nbsp; <i>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to 
you</i>, <i>do ye even so to them</i>; <i>for this is the law and the 
prophets</i>.&nbsp; Matt. vii. 12.&nbsp; <i>Thou shalt love thy neighbour 
as thyself</i>.&nbsp; Matt. xix. 19.&nbsp; And who is thy neighbour?&nbsp; 
Read the parable of the Good Samaritan, and <i>Go and do 
likewise</i>.&nbsp; Luke x. 15.</p>
<p>The author will finally conclude by observing, that England will have a 
great deal to answer for in reference to the Gipsies of past 
generations.&nbsp; For, from a very moderate calculation that he has made, 
150,000 of these outcasts have passed into the eternal world, uninformed, 
unacquainted with God, since they came to this country.&nbsp; May the 
present, and succeeding generations, be wiser than the past!</p>
<h2><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
165</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<p>Since the <span class="smcap">Gipsies&rsquo; Advocate</span> was put to 
press, the author, as might naturally be expected on a subject so 
interesting as the conversion of the Gipsies, has had many other pleasing 
communications.&nbsp; From his Bristol correspondents he has been favoured 
with several of delightful interest, in reference to a small colony in that
neighbourhood; and these state that several of the Gipsies not only begin 
to evidence an aversion to their former life, but increase in seriousness, 
and in habits of industry.&nbsp; And happy is he to say, that several 
influential Christians of that city are growing in the interest they 
manifest to these outcasts of society; for they are endeavouring to improve
every opportunity of affording them instruction.&nbsp; It is with peculiar 
pleasure too, the author learns, that the students of the Baptist Academy 
of the above-named city, are not dead to the affecting necessities of this 
poor people.&nbsp; Some of the students of that academy spent the whole of 
one day in endeavouring to find one of their large encampments, of which 
they had had some previous information, and spent the evening in giving 
such instruction as appeared to them to be the best calculated to enlighten
and reform the people to whom they were so anxious to do good; some of them
occupying <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
166</span>themselves with the children, and others with the adults.&nbsp; 
May their example have its due influence on surrounding Christians!</p>
<p>The author must not forget to mention here, that he has been apprised by
the clergyman in Scotland, whose letter forms so interesting a part of the 
ninth chapter, that the account he mentioned to him, as gaining insertion 
in a statistical publication, has not been published, he believes, in 
consequence of the death of the gentleman who had interested himself for 
its insertion in the work referred to; but that he hopes it may meet the 
public eye in a short time.</p>
<p>And now, having redeemed the pledge which he gave his friends about 
twelve months since; having furnished them with a history of the Gipsies, 
such a one as he hopes will be beneficial to the race, whose conduct, 
condition, and necessities it narrates; he will conclude by thanking those 
kind friends who have unintentionally contributed to the interest of these 
pages, and by asking the continuation of their favours, with a view to give
increasing interest to an intended second edition.&nbsp; He would not 
forget publicly to solicit, likewise, the correspondence of ladies and 
gentlemen who may be in possession of facts or plans likely to interest the
public towards the Gipsies.</p>
<p>The author now commits these pages to the all-influential blessing of 
God, earnestly praying that these poor, hard-faring wanderers, whose 
character he has endeavoured to delineate, may be speedily rescued from 
their present forlorn condition, and, that they may eventually <!-- page 
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>be conducted
to the mansions of eternal bliss, where neither storm nor tempest shall any
longer afflict them, but where they shall join with the ransomed of the 
Lord, in ascribing <i>blessing</i>, <i>and honour</i>, <i>and glory</i>, 
<i>and power</i>, <i>unto him that sitteth upon the throne</i>, <i>and unto
the Lamb for ever and ever</i>.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
